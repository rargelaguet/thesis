	Abstract = {Mammalian organogenesis is a remarkable process. Within a short timeframe, the cells of the three germ layers transform into an embryo that includes most of the major internal and external organs. Here we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of mouse organogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing, we profiled the transcriptomes of around 2 million cells derived from 61 embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation, in a single experiment. The resulting mouse organogenesis cell atlas (MOCA) provides a global view of developmental processes during this critical window. We use Monocle 3 to identify hundreds of cell types and 56 trajectories, many of which are detected only because of the depth of cellular coverage, and collectively define thousands of corresponding marker genes. We explore the dynamics of gene expression within cell types and trajectories over time, including focused analyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle.},

Recent experimental high-throughput techniques, such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) provide important information about the architecture of the regulatory networks in the cell. However, it is very difficult to measure the concentration levels of transcription factor proteins and determine their regulatory effect on gene transcription. It is therefore an important computational challenge to infer these quantities using gene expression data and network architecture data.Results: We develop a probabilistic state space model that allows genome-wide inference of both transcription factor protein concentrations and their effect on the transcription rates of each target gene from microarray data. We use variational inference techniques to learn the model parameters and perform posterior inference of protein concentrations and regulatory strengths. The probabilistic nature of the model also means that we can associate credibility intervals to our estimates, as well as providing a tool to detect which binding events lead to significant regulation. We demonstrate our model on artificial data and on two yeast datasets in which the network structure has previously been obtained using ChIP data. Predictions from our model are consistent with the underlying biology and offer novel quantitative insights into the regulatory structure of the yeast cell.Availability: MATLAB code is available from Contact:guido@dcs.shef.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online}",

However, inferring population structure in large modern data sets imposes severe computational challenges. Here, we develop efficient algorithms for approximate inference of the model underlying the STRUCTURE program using a variational Bayesian framework. Variational methods pose the problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the number of populations represented in a data set and a new hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data and illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH{\textendash}Human Genome Diversity Panel. The variational algorithms are almost two orders of magnitude faster than STRUCTURE and achieve accuracies comparable to those of ADMIXTURE. Furthermore, our results show that the heuristic scores for choosing model complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number of populations represented in the data, with minimal bias toward detecting structure when it is very weak. Our algorithm, fastSTRUCTURE, is freely available online at http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html.},

  abstract  = "Author SummaryIn scientific and medical studies, great care must
               be taken when collecting data to understand the relationship
               between two variables, such as a drug and its effect on a
               disease. In any given study there will be many other variables
               at play, such as the effects of age and sex on the disease. We
               show that in studies where the expression levels of thousands of
               genes are measured at once, these issues become surprisingly
               critical. Due to the complexity of our genomes, environment, and
               demographic features, there are many sources of variation when
               analyzing gene expression levels. In any given study, it is
               impossible to measure every single variable that may be
               influencing how our genes are expressed. Despite this, we show
               that by considering all expression levels simultaneously, one
               can actually recover the effects of these important missed
               variables and essentially produce an analysis as if all relevant
               variables were included. As opposed to traditional studies, the
               massive amount of data available in this setting is what makes
               the method, called surrogate variable analysis, possible. We

Uncovering these genome-scale interactions constitutes a major bottleneck in systems biology. Sparse latent factor models, assuming activity of transcription factors (TFs) as unobserved, provide a biologically interpretable modelling framework, integrating gene expression and genome-wide binding data, but at the same time pose a hard computational inference problem. Existing probabilistic inference methods for such models rely on subjective filtering and suffer from scalability issues, thus are not well-suited for realistic genome-scale applications.We present a fast Bayesian sparse factor model, which takes input gene expression and binding sites data, either from ChIP-seq experiments or motif predictions, and outputs active TF-gene links as well as latent TF activities. Our method employs an efficient variational Bayes scheme for model inference enabling its application to large datasets which was not feasible with existing MCMC-based inference methods for such models. We validate our method on synthetic data against a similar model in the literature, employing MCMC for inference, and obtain comparable results with a small fraction of the computational time. We also apply our method to large-scale data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis involving ChIP-seq data on 113 TFs and matched gene expression data for 3863 putative target genes. We evaluate our predictions using an independent transcriptomics experiment involving over-expression of TFs.An easy-to-use Jupyter notebook demo of our method with data is available at https://github.com/zhenwendai/SITAR.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

In this article, we provide a comprehensive review on omics and clinical data integration techniques, from a machine learning perspective, for various analyses such as prediction, clustering, dimension reduction and association. We shall show that Bayesian models are able to use prior information and model measurements with various distributions; tree-based methods can either build a tree with all features or collectively make a final decision based on trees learned from each view; kernel methods fuse the similarity matrices learned from individual views together for a final similarity matrix or learning model; network-based fusion methods are capable of inferring direct and indirect associations in a heterogeneous network; matrix factorization models have potential to learn interactions among features from different views; and a range of deep neural networks can be integrated in multi-modal learning for capturing the complex mechanism of biological systems.}",

We describe a number of inference algorithms for Bayesian sparse factor analysis using a slab and spike mixture prior. These include well-established Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational Bayes (VB) algorithms as well as a novel hybrid of VB and Expectation Propagation (EP). For the case of a single latent factor we derive a theory for learning performance using the replica method. We compare the MCMC and VB/EP algorithm results with simulated data to the theoretical prediction. The results for MCMC agree closely with the theory as expected. Results for VB/EP are slightly sub-optimal but show that the new algorithm is effective for sparse inference. In large-scale problems MCMC is infeasible due to computational limitations and the VB/EP algorithm then provides a very useful computationally efficient alternative.}

abstract = {One of the central issues in the use of principal component analysis (PCA) for data modelling is that of choosing the appropriate number of retained components. This problem was recently addressed through the formulation of a Bayesian treatment of PCA (Bishop, 1998) in terms of a probabilistic latent variable model. A central feature of this approach is that the effective dimensionality of the latent space (equivalent to the number of retained principal components) is determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. In common with most non-trivial Bayesian models, however, the required marginalizations are analytically intractable, and so an approximation scheme based on a local Gaussian representation of the posterior distribution was employed. In this paper we develop an alternative, variational formulation of Bayesian PCA, based on a factorial representation of the posterior distribution. This approach is computationally efficient, and unlike other approximation schemes, it maximizes a rigourous lower bound on the marginal log probability of the observed data.

The ability to study biological phenomena at omics levels in turn is expected to lead to significant advances in personalized and precision medicine. Patients can be treated according to their own molecular characteristics. Individual omes as well as the integrated profiles of multiple omes, such as the genome, the epigenome, the transcriptome, the proteome, the metabolome, the antibodyome, and other omics information are expected to be valuable for health monitoring, preventative measures, and precision medicine. Moreover, omics technologies have the potential to transform medicine from traditional symptom-oriented diagnosis and treatment of diseases toward disease prevention and early diagnostics. We discuss here the advances and challenges in systems biology-powered personalized medicine at its current stage, as well as a prospective view of future personalized health care at the end of this review.

Many predict the emergence of personalized medicine in the near future. We are, however, moving from two-tiered health systems to a two-tiered personalized medicine. Omics facilities are restricted to affluent regions, and personalized medicine is likely to widen the growing gap in health systems between high and low-income countries. This is mirrored by an increasing lag between our ability to generate and analyze big data. Several bottlenecks slow-down the transition from conventional to personalized medicine: generation of cost-effective high-throughput data; hybrid education and multidisciplinary teams; data storage and processing; data integration and interpretation; and individual and global economic relevance. This review provides an update of important developments in the analysis of big data and forward strategies to accelerate the global transition to personalized medicine.",

              sequencing discovers increasingly comprehensive mutation
              repertoires, the functional relationships of mutations to tumor
              phenotypes remain largely unknown. Here, we measured ex vivo
              sensitivity of 246 blood cancers to 63 drugs alongside genome,
              transcriptome, and DNA methylome analysis to understand
              determinants of drug response. We assembled a primary blood
              cancer cell encyclopedia data set that revealed disease-specific
              sensitivities for each cancer. Within chronic lymphocytic
              leukemia (CLL), responses to 62\% of drugs were associated with 2
              or more mutations, and linked the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway
              to trisomy 12, an important driver of CLL. Based on drug
              responses, the disease could be organized into phenotypic
              subgroups characterized by exploitable dependencies on BCR, mTOR,
              or MEK signaling and associated with mutations, gene expression,
              and DNA methylation. Fourteen percent of CLLs were driven by mTOR
              signaling in a non-BCR-dependent manner. Multivariate modeling
              revealed immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) mutation
              status and trisomy 12 as the most important modulators of
              response to kinase inhibitors in CLL. Ex vivo drug responses were
              associated with outcome. This study overcomes the perception that
              most mutations do not influence drug response of cancer, and
              points to an updated approach to understanding tumor biology,

              cancer-specific events, including divergent epigenetic patterns.
              Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of normal B cell subsets,
              we observed broad epigenetic programming of selective

              we showed that tumors derive largely from a continuum of
              maturation states reflected in normal developmental stages.
              Epigenetic maturation in CLL was associated with an indolent gene
              expression pattern and increasingly favorable clinical outcomes.
              We further uncovered that most previously reported tumor-specific
              methylation events are normally present in non-malignant B cells.
              Instead, we identified a potential pathogenic role for

              leukemia (CLL) destined to progress would greatly facilitate
              their clinical management. Recently, whole-genome DNA methylation
              analyses identified three clinicobiologic CLL subgroups with an
              epigenetic signature related to different normal B-cell
              counterparts. Here, we developed a clinically applicable method
              to identify these subgroups and to study their clinical
              relevance. Using a support vector machine approach, we built a
              prediction model using five epigenetic biomarkers that was able
              to classify CLL patients accurately into the three subgroups,
              namely naive B-cell-like, intermediate and memory B-cell-like
              CLL. DNA methylation was quantified by highly reproducible
              bisulfite pyrosequencing assays in two independent CLL series. In
              the initial series (n=211), the three subgroups showed
              differential levels of IGHV (immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus)
              mutation (P<0.001) and VH usage (P<0.03), as well as different
              clinical features and outcome in terms of time to first treatment
              (TTT) and overall survival (P<0.001). A multivariate Cox model
              showed that epigenetic classification was the strongest predictor
              of TTT (P<0.001) along with Binet stage (P<0.001). These findings
              were corroborated in a validation series (n=97). In this study,
              we developed a simple and robust method using epigenetic

One such predictive biomarker is the mutational status of the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) gene, which is a powerful predictor of duration of response and overall survival with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). As this test may influence choice of therapy between CIT and novel agents, it is critical that providers understand how mutational status is determined and the limitations of testing. Here, we describe the details of IGHV mutational status testing, highlighting the appropriate way to interpret this information and best apply it to the care of patients with CLL.},

              influence of these factors on clinical outcome in responding
              patients after therapy. We here propose to analyse the impact of
              IGHV gene status, LPL and ADAM29 gene expression on disease-free
              survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in 41 stage B or C CLL
              patients in remission after oral fludarabine plus
              cyclophosphamide. The median follow-up was of 64 (16-74) months.
              Sequencing of IGHV showed mutated (M) VH genes in 16 of 41 cases
              and unmutated (UM) in 25 cases. Analysis of LPL and ADAM29
              expression in 35 of 41 cases showed overexpression of ADAM29 in
              17 cases (14 M and three UM) and LPL in 18 cases (all UM).
              Patients expressing UM IGHV and LPL had shorter DFS and OS when
              compared to patients expressing M IGHV and/or ADAM29.
              Furthermore, blood minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation

              two patient subgroups: with good mutated ZAP70 negative
              (MTZAP70(-) and poor unmutated ZAP70 positive (UMZAP70(+))
              prognosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the gene expression
              of B cells in 112 CLL patients divided into three classes: class
              1 with MTZAP70(-), class 2 with UMZAP70(+), and class 3 included
              both UMZAP70(-) and MTZAP70(+). RESULTS: We found LPL, AGPAT2,
              MBOAT1, CHPT1, AGPAT4, PLD1 genes encoding enzymes involved in
              lipid metabolism overexpressed in UMZAP70(+). In addition, this
              study identified ARSD, a gene belonging to the sphingolipid
              metabolism, as a new gene significantly overexpressed in
              UMZAP70(+) compared to MTZAP70(-). Western blots confirmed that
              ARSD protein levels were significantly different between the 3
              classes of patients and normal controls. Statistical analysis
              identified a significant correlation between ARSD and IGVH;
              however, both ARSD protein level and IGVH were independently
              associated with the need for therapy of CLL patients.
              CONCLUSIONS: ARSD is a novel prognostic factor as the time to
              start therapy is shorter in patients with high levels of ARSD
              protein and sphingolipid metabolism could represent a new

However, this technology has also raised several new computational challenges. These include questions about the best methods for clustering scRNA-Seq data, how to identify unique group of cells in such experiments, and how to determine the state or function of specific cells based on their expression profile. To address these issues we develop and test a method based on neural networks (NN) for the analysis and retrieval of single cell RNA-Seq data. We tested various NN architectures, some of which incorporate prior biological knowledge, and used these to obtain a reduced dimension representation of the single cell expression data. We show that the NN method improves upon prior methods in both, the ability to correctly group cells in experiments not used in the training and the ability to correctly infer cell type or state by querying a database of tens of thousands of single cell profiles. Such database queries (which can be performed using our web server) will enable researchers to better characterize cells when analyzing heterogeneous scRNA-Seq samples.}",

               data sets with multiple missing expression values.
               Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis
               require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For
               example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means
               clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose
               effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for
               imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the
               effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the
               range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In
               this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating
               missing data.Results: We present a comparative study of several
               methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray
               data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular
               Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted
               K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated
               the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over
               different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the
               imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range
               of 1--20\% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to
               provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value
               estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute
               surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling
               missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative
               experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate
               estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of
               conditions.Availability: The software is available at

	abstract = {The analysis of censored failure times is considered. It is assumed that on each individual are available values of one or more explanatory variables. The hazard function (age-specific failure rate) is taken to be a function of the explanatory variables and unknown regression coefficients multiplied by an arbitrary and unknown function of time. A conditional likelihood is obtained, leading to inferences about the unknown regression coefficients. Some generalizations are outlined.},

	abstract = {Bayesian hierarchical models are attractive structures for conducting regression analyses when the data are subject to missingness. However, the requisite probability calculus is challenging and Monte Carlo methods typically are employed. We develop an alternative approach based on deterministic variational Bayes approximations. Both parametric and nonparametric regression are considered. Attention is restricted to the more challenging case of missing predictor data. We demonstrate that variational Bayes can achieve good accuracy, but with considerably less computational overhead. The main ramification is fast approximate Bayesian inference in parametric and nonparametric regression models with missing data. Supplemental materials accompany the online version of this article.},
