	Abstract = {Mammalian organogenesis is a remarkable process. Within a short timeframe, the cells of the three germ layers transform into an embryo that includes most of the major internal and external organs. Here we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of mouse organogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing, we profiled the transcriptomes of around 2 million cells derived from 61 embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation, in a single experiment. The resulting `mouse organogenesis cell atlas'(MOCA) provides a global view of developmental processes during this critical window. We use Monocle 3 to identify hundreds of cell types and 56 trajectories, many of which are detected only because of the depth of cellular coverage, and collectively define thousands of corresponding marker genes. We explore the dynamics of gene expression within cell types and trajectories over time, including focused analyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle.},

 abstract = {Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

Recent experimental high-throughput techniques, such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) provide important information about the architecture of the regulatory networks in the cell. However, it is very difficult to measure the concentration levels of transcription factor proteins and determine their regulatory effect on gene transcription. It is therefore an important computational challenge to infer these quantities using gene expression data and network architecture data.Results: We develop a probabilistic state space model that allows genome-wide inference of both transcription factor protein concentrations and their effect on the transcription rates of each target gene from microarray data. We use variational inference techniques to learn the model parameters and perform posterior inference of protein concentrations and regulatory strengths. The probabilistic nature of the model also means that we can associate credibility intervals to our estimates, as well as providing a tool to detect which binding events lead to significant regulation. We demonstrate our model on artificial data and on two yeast datasets in which the network structure has previously been obtained using ChIP data. Predictions from our model are consistent with the underlying biology and offer novel quantitative insights into the regulatory structure of the yeast cell.Availability: MATLAB code is available from Contact:guido@dcs.shef.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online}",

However, inferring population structure in large modern data sets imposes severe computational challenges. Here, we develop efficient algorithms for approximate inference of the model underlying the STRUCTURE program using a variational Bayesian framework. Variational methods pose the problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the number of populations represented in a data set and a new hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data and illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH{\textendash}Human Genome Diversity Panel. The variational algorithms are almost two orders of magnitude faster than STRUCTURE and achieve accuracies comparable to those of ADMIXTURE. Furthermore, our results show that the heuristic scores for choosing model complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number of populations represented in the data, with minimal bias toward detecting structure when it is very weak. Our algorithm, fastSTRUCTURE, is freely available online at http://pritchardlab.stanford.edu/structure.html.},

  abstract  = "Author SummaryIn scientific and medical studies, great care must
               be taken when collecting data to understand the relationship
               between two variables, such as a drug and its effect on a
               disease. In any given study there will be many other variables
               at play, such as the effects of age and sex on the disease. We
               show that in studies where the expression levels of thousands of
               genes are measured at once, these issues become surprisingly
               critical. Due to the complexity of our genomes, environment, and
               demographic features, there are many sources of variation when
               analyzing gene expression levels. In any given study, it is
               impossible to measure every single variable that may be
               influencing how our genes are expressed. Despite this, we show
               that by considering all expression levels simultaneously, one
               can actually recover the effects of these important missed
               variables and essentially produce an analysis as if all relevant
               variables were included. As opposed to traditional studies, the
               massive amount of data available in this setting is what makes
               the method, called surrogate variable analysis, possible. We

    abstract = "{Regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes involves complex co-regulatory mechanisms involving large numbers of transcriptional regulatory proteins and their target genes. Uncovering these genome-scale interactions constitutes a major bottleneck in systems biology. Sparse latent factor models, assuming activity of transcription factors (TFs) as unobserved, provide a biologically interpretable modelling framework, integrating gene expression and genome-wide binding data, but at the same time pose a hard computational inference problem. Existing probabilistic inference methods for such models rely on subjective filtering and suffer from scalability issues, thus are not well-suited for realistic genome-scale applications.We present a fast Bayesian sparse factor model, which takes input gene expression and binding sites data, either from ChIP-seq experiments or motif predictions, and outputs active TF-gene links as well as latent TF activities. Our method employs an efficient variational Bayes scheme for model inference enabling its application to large datasets which was not feasible with existing MCMC-based inference methods for such models. We validate our method on synthetic data against a similar model in the literature, employing MCMC for inference, and obtain comparable results with a small fraction of the computational time. We also apply our method to large-scale data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis involving ChIP-seq data on 113 TFs and matched gene expression data for 3863 putative target genes. We evaluate our predictions using an independent transcriptomics experiment involving over-expression of TFs.An easy-to-use Jupyter notebook demo of our method with data is available at https://github.com/zhenwendai/SITAR.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

In this article, we provide a comprehensive review on omics and clinical data integration techniques, from a machine learning perspective, for various analyses such as prediction, clustering, dimension reduction and association. We shall show that Bayesian models are able to use prior information and model measurements with various distributions; tree-based methods can either build a tree with all features or collectively make a final decision based on trees learned from each view; kernel methods fuse the similarity matrices learned from individual views together for a final similarity matrix or learning model; network-based fusion methods are capable of inferring direct and indirect associations in a heterogeneous network; matrix factorization models have potential to learn interactions among features from different views; and a range of deep neural networks can be integrated in multi-modal learning for capturing the complex mechanism of biological systems.}",

MOVIE plots the contributions of one data type against another to produce contribution plots, where contributions are calculated for each subject and each data type from the results of each multi-omics method. The usefulness of MOVIE is demonstrated by applying existing multi-omics methods to permuted null data and breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

               relationships that best explain the correlated structure across
               data sets, the variability both within and between variables (or
               observations) and may highlight data issues such as batch
               effects or outliers. We explore dimension reduction techniques

	abstract = {Bayesian sparse factor analysis has many applications; for example, it has been applied to the problem of inferring a sparse regulatory network from gene expression data. We describe a number of inference algorithms for Bayesian sparse factor analysis using a slab and spike mixture prior. These include well-established Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational Bayes (VB) algorithms as well as a novel hybrid of VB and Expectation Propagation (EP). For the case of a single latent factor we derive a theory for learning performance using the replica method. We compare the MCMC and VB/EP algorithm results with simulated data to the theoretical prediction. The results for MCMC agree closely with the theory as expected. Results for VB/EP are slightly sub-optimal but show that the new algorithm is effective for sparse inference. In large-scale problems MCMC is infeasible due to computational limitations and the VB/EP algorithm then provides a very useful computationally efficient alternative.}

abstract = {One of the central issues in the use of principal component analysis (PCA) for data modelling is that of choosing the appropriate number of retained components. This problem was recently addressed through the formulation of a Bayesian treatment of PCA (Bishop, 1998) in terms of a probabilistic latent variable model. A central feature of this approach is that the effective dimensionality of the latent space (equivalent to the number of retained principal components) is determined automatically as part of the Bayesian inference procedure. In common with most non-trivial Bayesian models, however, the required marginalizations are analytically intractable, and so an approximation scheme based on a local Gaussian representation of the posterior distribution was employed. In this paper we develop an alternative, variational formulation of Bayesian PCA, based on a factorial representation of the posterior distribution. This approach is computationally efficient, and unlike other approximation schemes, it maximizes a rigourous lower bound on the marginal log probability of the observed data.
