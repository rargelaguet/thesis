The accuracy of the two types of methods is not easy to compare and is model as well as data-set dependent, but given  \cite{}. Yet, variational inference generally underestimates the variance of the posterior distributions, as will be discussed in [[Section X]]. While this is can be a limitation in some scenarios \cite{vallejosBasics}, it is a price that can be paid when aiming at approximate solutions and working with point estimates \cite{???}

Under these (general) assumptions, the ELBO as a function of \lambda becomes:
\[

\]
Using the exponential family identity that the expectation of the sufficient statistics is the gradient of the log normalizer $ \E_q[t(\beta)] = \nabla_\lambda a_g(\lambda)$:
\[
\Lagr(\lambda) = \E_q[log h(\beta) + \eta_g(x,z,\alpha)^T \nabla_\lambda a_g(\lambda)] - \E_q[\log(h(\beta)) + \lambda^T \nabla_\lambda a_g(\lambda) - a_g(\lambda) ] + const
\]

Then we take the gradient with respect to $\lambda$:
\[
\nabla \Lagr(\lambda) = \nabla^2_\lambda a_g(\lambda) (\E_q[\eta_g(x,z,\alpha)] - \lambda)
\]

Single-cell genome sequencing was the first molecular layer to be profiled in a high-throughput manner at the single-cell level \cite{???}

(COPIEd ) or example, it is now possible to use single-cell genomics to identify and assemble the genomes of unculturable microorganisms5, evaluate the roles of genetic mosaicism in normal physiology and disease6, and determine the contributions of intra-tumour genetic heterogeneity in cancer development or treatment response7.
