First and foremost, I would like to thank my co-supervisors John Marioni and Oliver Stegle for their guidance and support throughout my PhD and for introducing me to the exciting field of factor analysis models and single-cell data. I thank Wolf Reik, Stephen Clark and Carine Stapel for being the best experimental collaborators one could possibly ask for. I express my gratitude to the whole Stegle and Marioni groups and the people who has provided valuable support, discussions and inspirations for my work, including Andreas Kapourani, Marc Jan Bonder, Davis McCarthy, Daniel Seaton, Yuanhua Huang, among others. A special thank you note to Damien Arnol, for insightful discussions on data modelling. In addition, I want to thank the entire MOFA team, including Britta Velten, Yonatan Deloro, Florian Buettner and Danila Bredikhin. I am very grateful to have worked together with all of you.\\
Last, but not least, a sincere thank you to my girlfriend Mari and to my family for your unconditional support.
