\section{Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression in single cells}

\subsection{Description of the experimental protocol} \label{section:scnmt_protocol}

scNMT-seq builds upon two previous multi-modal protocols: single-cell Methylation and Transcriptome sequencing (scM\&T-seq) \cite{Angermueller2016} and Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylation sequencing (NOMe-seq) \cite{Kelly2012,Pott2016}. An overview of the protocol is shown in \Cref{fig:scnmt_protocol}.

In the first step (the NOMe-seq step), cells are sorted into individual wells and incubated with a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI). This enzyme labels accessible (or nucleosome depleted) GpC sites via DNA methylation\cite{Kilgore2007, Kelly2012}. In mammalian genomes, cytosine residues in GpC dinucleotides are methylated at a very low rate. Hence, after M.CviPI treatment, GpC methylation marks can be interpreted as direct read outs for chromatin accessibility, as opposed to the CpG methylation readouts, which can be interpreted as endogenous DNA methylation\cite{Kilgore2007, Kelly2012}.

In a second step (the scM\&T-seq step), the DNA molecules are separated from the mRNA using oligo-dT probes pre-annealed to magnetic beads. Subsequently, the DNA fraction undergoes single-cell bisulfite conversion\cite{Smallwood2014}, whereas the RNA fraction undergoes Smart-seq2 \cite{Picelli2014}.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption[]{\textbf{scNMT-seq protocol overview.}\\
	In the first step, cells are isolated and lysed. Second, cells are incubated with a GpC methyltransferase. Third, the RNA fraction is separated using oligo-dT probes and sequenced using Smart-seq2. The DNA fraction undergoes scBS-seq library preparation and sequencing. Finally, CpG Methylation and GpC chromatin accessibility data are separated computationally.}
	\label{fig:scnmt_protocol}
\end{figure}

As discussed in \Cref{section:chromatin_accessibility}, NOMe-seq has a range of appealing properties in comparison with count-based methods such as ATAC-seq or DNAseq-seq. First, the obvious gain of simultaneously measuring another epigenetic readout such as DNA methylation with little additional cost. Second, the resolution of the method is determined by the frequency of GpC sites within the genome ($\approx$ 1 in 16 bp), rather than the size of a library fragment (usually >100 bp). This allows the robust inspection of individual regulatory elements, nucleosome positioning and transcription factor footprints \cite{Kelly2012,Pott2016,Nordstrom2019}. Third, missing data can be easily discriminated from inaccessible chromatin. Importantly, this implies that lowly accessible sites will not suffer from increased technical variation (due to low read counts) compared to highly accessible sites. Finally, the M.CviPI enzyme shows less sequence motif biases than the DNAse or the Tn5 transposase \cite{Nordstrom2019}.

The downsides of the approach are the limited scalability associated with plate-based methods, and the need to discard read outs from (1) GCG positions (21\%), as it is intrinsically not possible to distinguish endogenous methylation from \textit{in vitro} methylated bases, and (2) CGC positions (27\%), to mitigate off-target effects of the enzyme \cite{Kelly2012}. This filtering step reduces the number of genome-wide cytosines that can be assayed from 22 million to 11 million. 


\subsection{Description of the data processing pipeline}

After DNA sequencing, reads undergo quality control and trimming using TrimGalore to remove the flanking 6bp (the random primers), adaptor contamination and poor-quality base calls. Subsequently, trimmed reads are aligned to the corresponding genome assembly. Here we used Bismark \cite{Krueger2011} with the additional --NOMe option, which produces CpG report files containing only ACG and TCG trinucleotides and GpC report files containing only GCA, GCC and GCT positions. After mapping, a new round of quality control is performed per cell based on mapping efficiency, bisulfite conversion efficiency and library size.\\
Finally, methylation calls for each CpG and GpC site are calculated after removal of duplicate alignments. Following the approach of \cite{Smallwood2014}, individual CpG or GpC sites in each cell are modelled using a binomial model where the number of successes is the number of methylated reads and the number of trials is the total number of reads. A CpG methylation or GpC accessibility rate for each site and cell is calculated by maximum likelihood.

% When quantifying DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility over genomic features (i.e. promoters or enhancers) instead of individual CpG or GpC sites, a binomial model is again assumed. For each cell and feature, we calculated a...but aggregating the counts over all CpG (methylation) and GpC (accessibility) dinucleotides overlapping the genomic feature.

\subsection{Data validation}

\subsubsection{Coverage} \label{section:scnmt_coverage}

We validated scNMT-seq in 70 EL16 mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), together with three cells processed without M.CviPI enzyme treatment (i.e. using scM\&T-seq). The use of this relatively simple and well-studied \textit{in vitro} system allows us to compare our DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility statistics to published data \cite{Smallwood2014,Angermueller2016,Ficz2013}.

First, we compared the theoretical maximum coverage that could be achieved with the empirical coverage (\Cref{fig:scnmt_coverage}). Despite the reduction in theoretical coverage due to the removal of ambiguous CCG and GCG sites, we observed, for DNA methylation, a median of $\approx$ 50\% of promoters, $\approx$ 75\% of gene bodies and $\approx$ 25\% of active enhancers captured by at least 5 CpGs in each cell. Nevertheless, limited coverage is indeed observed for small genomic contexts such as p300 ChIP-seq peaks (median of $\approx$ 200bp).\\
For chromatin accessibility, coverage was larger than that observed for endogenous methylation due to the higher frequency of GpC dinucleotides, with a median of $\approx$ 85\% of gene bodies and $\approx$ 75\% of promoters measured with at least 5 GpCs.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{scNMT_coverage}

	\label{fig:scnmt_coverage}
\end{figure}

Next, we compared the DNA methylation coverage with a similar data set profiled by scM\&T-seq \cite{Angermueller2016} (\Cref{fig:scnmt_coverage}), where the the conflictive trinucleotides are not excluded.\\
Despite scNMT-seq yielding less CpG measurements, we find little differences in coverage when quantifying DNA methylation over genomic contexts, albeit these become evident when down-sampling the number of reads.

	\label{fig:scnmt_coverage2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Consistency with previous studies}

To assess the consistency with previous studies we quantified DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility using a running window throughout the genome. The resulting methylomes were compared to data sets from the same cell lines profiled with similar technologies, including scM\&T-seq\cite{Angermueller2016}, scBS-seq\cite{Smallwood2014} and bulk BS-seq\cite{Ficz2013}. We find that most of the variation is not attributed to the technology but to differences in culture condition (2i vs serum, captured by PC1). This result is expected, as cells grown in 2i media remain in a native pluripotency state that is associated with genome-wide DNA hypomethylation \cite{Ficz2013}. Interestingly, the serum-cultured cells processed in this study overlapped with 2i-cultured cells from previous data sets. suggesting that they remained in a more pluripotent state. The most likely explanation for this variation is the differences in the cell lines (we used female EL16 versus male E14 in \cite{Angermueller2016,Smallwood2014,Ficz2013}). Previous studies have sown that female ESCs tend to show lower levels of mean global methylation, which is consistent with a more pluripotent phenotype \cite{Zvetkova2005}.\\

In terms of accessibility, no NOMe-seq measurements were available for ESCs at the time of the study, so we compared it to bulk DNase-seq data from the same cell type, yielding good consistency between datasets ($R=0.74$).

\end{figure}


\subsection{Quantification of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in known regulatory regions}

We pseudobulked the data across all cells and we examined DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility levels at loci with known regulatory roles. We found that in CTCF binding sites and DNaseI hypersensitivity sites DNA methylation was decreased while chromatin accessibility was increased, as previously reported \cite{Pott2016}. As a control, we observe that cells which did not receive M.CviPI treatment showed globally low GpC methylation levels ( $\approx$ 2\%, \Cref{fig:scmt_pseudobulk_profiles}).

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{scnmt_pseudobulk_profiles}
	\caption[]{\textbf{Accessibility and methylation profiles in regulatory genomic contexts.}\\
	First, we pseudobulk the data set by pooling information across all cells. Next, we compute running averages of the CpG methylation (red) and the GpC accessibility (blue) in consecutive non-overlapping 50bp windows.

	\label{fig:scnmt_pseudobulk_profiles}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Quantification of the association between molecular layers.}

We attempted to reconstruct the expected directional relationships between the transcriptome and the epigenome, namely the positive association between RNA expression and chromatin accessibility and the negative association between DNA methylation and RNA expression \cite{Thurman2012,Angermueller2016}.\\
To get a measure of the association (or coupling) between two molecular layers, we quantified a linear association per cell (across genes). Notice that this approach is not exclusive to single-cell data and can also be computed (more accurately) with bulk measurements. Reassuringly, this analysis confirmed, even within single cells, the expected positive correlation between chromatin accessibility and RNA expression, and the negative correlations between RNA expression and DNA methylation, and between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{scNMT_correlations_acrossgenes}

	The top diagram illustrates the computation of an association test per cell (across all loci in a given genomic context). The left panel shows DNA methylation versus RNA expression. The middle panel shows DNA methylation versus chromatin accessibility. The right panel shows RNA expression versus chromatin accessibility. The x-axis displays the Pearson correlation coefficients between two molecular layers, per genomic context (y-axis). The box plots summarise the distribution of correlation coefficients across cells. The dots and stars show the linear associations quantified in pseudo-bulked scNMT-seq data and published bulk data from the same cell types \cite{Ficz2013,ENCODE2012}, respectively. }
	\label{fig:scNMT_correlations_acrossgenes}
\end{figure}

% Consistently, when stratifiying the loci from \Cref{fig:scnmt_profiles} based on the expression level of the nearest gene, we observe that higher RNA expression is associated with chromatin openness and decreased DNA methylation levels \Cref{fig:scnmt_profiles_byexpr}.

\subsection{Identification of genomic elements with coordinated variability across molecular layers}

Having validated the quality of scNMT-seq data with a simple and relatively homogeneous data set, we next explored its potential to identify coordinated heterogeneity between the transcriptome and the epigenome.\\
We generated a second data set of 43 embryonic stem cells (after quality control), where we induced a differentiation process towards embryoid bodies by removing the LIF media for 3 days.\\Dimensionality reduction on the RNA expression data reveals the existence of two subpopulations: one with high expression of pluripotency markers (\textit{Esrrb} and \textit{Rex1}) and the other with high expression of differentiation markers (\textit{T} and \textit{Prtg}).

(b) Number of CpG sites (DNA methylation) observed. (c) Number of GpC sites (chromatin accessibility) observed. Dashed lines indicate binary thresholds, such that cells below the threshold are excluded for the downstream analysis.}

	The scatter plots show a t-SNE representation of the EB data. Cells are coloured based on expression of pluripotency factors (top) and differentiation markers (bottom). }
	\label{fig:scnmt_eb_rna}
\end{figure}

Next, we tested for locus-specific associations between pairwise combinations of molecular layers (correlation across cells, \Cref{fig:scnmt_eb_correlations}).\\
First, considering correlations between DNA methylation and RNA expression, we identified a majority of negative associations, reflecting the known relationship between these two layers. In contrast, we obtained largely positive associations between chromatin accessibility and RNA expression, mainly in promoters, p300 binding sites and super enhancer regions. Finally, we found mostly negative associations between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility. This confirms the expected direction of association between molecular layers, as reported in bulk studies.\\
As an illustrative example, we display the \textit{Esrrb} locus, a gene involved in early development and pluripotency \cite{Papp2012}. A previous study \cite{Angermueller2016}, identified a super enhancer near the gene that showed high degree of correlation between DNA methylation and RNA expression changes. In our study, we find \textit{Esrrb} to be expressed primarily in the pluripotent cells, consistent with its role in early development. When examining the epigenetic dynamics of the corresponding super enhancers, we observe a strong negative correlation between DNA methylation and RNA expression, thus replicating previous findings. Additionally, we observe a strong negative relationship between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, indicating the two epigenetic layers are tightly coupled

\end{figure}


\subsection{Inference of non-linear chromatin accessibility profiles at single nucleotide resolution}

A clear advantage of scNMT-seq is the high resolution of the its chromatin accessibility readouts, namely a binary output for each observed GpC dinucleotide. As illustrated in \Cref{fig:scnmt_pseudobulked_profiles}, GpC accessibility measurements rate extremely dynamic and display complex oscillatory patterns, likely due to presence of nucleosomes. This makes our approach of quantifying rates over a fixed genomic window not appropriate to capture the complexity of accessibility data. Therefore, we next attempted to exploit this high-resolution information to infer non-linear chromatin accessibility profiles at individual promoters.\\
The approach we followed is based on BPRMeth \cite{Kapourani2018}, a generalized linear regression model with Gaussian basis functions, coupled with a Bernoulli likelihood. A model was fit for every gene and every cell, provided enough coverage (at least 10 GpC sites observed per gene across 40\% of cells).\\
 Examples of inferred regression patterns are shown below:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{scNMT_profiles_examples}
	\caption[]{\textbf{Illustrative examples of single-cell accessibility profiles around the transcription start site}.\\
	Shown are representative profiles for two genes, \textit{Tmem54} and \textit{Tns1}. Each panel corresponds to separate cell. The y-axis displays the binary GpC accessibility values, with 1 being accessibility and 0 inaccessible. The x-axis displays the genomic region around the TSS (200bp upstream and downstream). The blue area depicts the inferred (non-linear) accessibility profile using the BPRMeth model \cite{Kapourani2018}.}
	\label{fig:scnmt_profiles_examples}
\end{figure}

As a first validation step, we showed that the accessibility profiles inferred around the transcription start site (TSS) lead to a better prediction of RNA expression than using conventional accessibility rates:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{scNMT_profiles_prediction}
	\caption[]{\textbf{Prediction of RNA expression using conventional accessibility rates (red) and non-linear accessibility profiles (blue)}.\\
	The y-axis displays the adjusted $R^2$ between observed RNA expression and predicted RNA expression. We fit a linear model per cell (across genes) where the response variable is RNA expression (log normalised counts) and the covariates are either the accessibility rate or the weights of the basis functions in BPRmeth.}
	\label{fig:scnmt_profiles_prediction}
\end{figure}

Consistently, when inspecting individual genes we observe that highly expressed genes show characteristic patterns of nucleosome depleted regions around the TSS, whereas lowly expressed genes show low levels of chromatin accessibility:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{scNMT_profiles_expr}
	\caption[]{\textbf{Single-cell accessibility profiles of representative genes with high and low expression levels.}\\
	Shown are \textit{Rpl5} and \textit{Eef1g} (high expression levels, top); \textit{Abcc9} and \textit{Theg} (low expression levels, bottom). Each panel corresponds to a separate cell. Axis are the same as in \Cref{fig:scnmt_profiles_examples}. }
	\label{fig:scnmt_profiles_highexpr}
\end{figure}

Next, we attempted at linking the heterogeneity in chromatin accessibility profiles with the variability in RNA expression.\\
A challenge of this augmented representation is how to find a one-dimensional statistic that summarises the heterogeneity across cells (as the variance statistic in conventional rates), which can be in turn correlated with summary statistics from the RNA expression. The approach we followed here is to cluster cells (per gene) based on the similarity of the accessibility profiles, using a finite mixture model with an expectation-maximisation algorithm. The optimal number of clusters was estimated using a Bayesian Information Criterion.\\
After model fitting, we considered the number of clusters as a proxy for accessibility heterogeneity, the rationale being that homogeneous genes will be grouped in a single cluster, while heterogeneous genes will contain a higher number of clusters. The result of the analysis is shown below:\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{scNMT_profiles_clusters}
	\caption[]{
	\textbf{Clustering chromatin accessibility profiles at gene promoters}. \\
	(a) Accessibility profiles are fitted for each cell and gene using 200 bp windows around the TSS. Then, a clustering step is applied for each gene and the most likely number of clusters is estimated using a Bayesian Information Criterion. Genes with higher numbers of clusters correspond to genes with increased heterogeneity compared to genes with small numbers of clusters.\\
	(b) Relationship between heterogeneity in the accessibility profile (x-axis) and average gene expression (across cells, y-axis).
	}
	\label{fig:scnmt_profiles_clusters}
\end{figure}

Genes with homogeneous accessibility profiles (fewer clusters) are associated with higher average expression levels. This includes genes with housekeeping functions, which are known to display highly conserved epigenetic features \cite{She2009}. In contrast, genes with heterogeneous accessibility (more clusters) are associated with lower expression levels. Interestingly, these genes are enriched for bivalent domains, containing both active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 histone marks (\Cref{fig:scnmt_profiles_histones}). As reported in previous studies, bivalent chromatin is normally associated with lowly-expressed genes that are poised for activation upon cell differentiation, thus playing a fundamental role in pluripotency and development \cite{Vastenhouw2012,Bernstein2006}

	\includegraphics[width=0.80\linewidth]{scNMT_profiles_histones}

	}
	\label{fig:scnmt_profiles_histones}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Exploration of epigenome connections along a developmental trajectory}

The use of single-cell technologies has permitted the unbiased study of continuous trajectories by computationally reconstructing the \textit{pseudotemporal} dynamics from the molecular profiles \cite{Trapnell2014,Haghverdi2016,Saelens2018}. A novel opportunity unveiled by the introduction of single-cell multi-modal technologies is the study of epigenetic dynamics along trajectories inferred from the transcriptome. To explore this idea, we applied a diffusion-based pseudotime method\cite{Haghverdi2016} to the EB data set, using the RNA expression of the 500 genes with highest biological overdispersion\cite{Lun2016b}. The first diffusion component was used to reconstruct a pseudotemporal ordering of cells from pluripotent to differentiated states:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{scNMT_pseudotime}
	\caption[]{\textbf{Reconstruction of developmental trajectory in embryoid body cells from the RNA expression data}.\\
	Each dot corresponds to one cell. The y-axis displays expression of \textit{Esrrb}, a canonical pluripotency marker, and the x-axis shows the position of the cells in the first diffusion component.}
	\label{fig:scnmt_pseudotime}
\end{figure}


Using the pseudotime reconstruction we investigated whether the strength of association between molecular layers (as calculated in \Cref{fig:scNMT_correlations_acrossgenes}) are affected along the developmental trajectory. To do this, we simply correlated the correlation coefficient across genes between each pair of molecular layers (one value per cell) versus the pseudotime position (\Cref{fig:scnmt_pseudotime_coupling}). Importantly, this analysis is possible by the continuous nature of single-cell data and by the ability of scNMT-seq to profile three molecular layers at the same time.\\
We observe that for DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility, the negative correlation coefficients decreases in important regulatory genomic contexts (\Cref{fig:scnmt_pseudotime_coupling}), such that pluripotent cells have a notably weaker methylation-chromatin coupling than differentiated cells. This suggests that the strength of regulation between molecular layers can be altered during cell fate decisions.

\section{Conclusions and open perspectives}

In this Chapter I have introduce single-cell nucleosome, methylation and transcription sequencing (scNMT-seq), an experimental protocol for the genome-wide profiling of RNA expression, DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in single cells. We have shown that this novel technology can be used to study the connection between the epigenome and the transcriptome in an unsupervised manner.

This protocol is an important step forward in the field of single-cell multi-modal sequencing. Yet, as with other protocols, the technology is still in a very early stage and numerous developments are expected to occur in the next years. These are the lines of research that I believe are important to improve scNMT-seq:

\begin{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Scalability}: scRNA-seq protocols are reaching the astonishing numbers of millions of cells per experiment, compared to the limited cell numbers achieved in multi-modal experiments \cite{Cao2019,Cao2018,Guo2017}. As in scRNA-seq, the maturation of multi-modal techniques will have a trade-off between sensitivity and scalability \cite{Chappell2018}. Under the assumption that most of the variance explained by epigenetic layers is driven by cis-regulation \cite{Bell2011}, we emphasise the importance of obtaining high-resolution measurements as provided by scNMT-seq. Hence, effort should be placed on making this comprehensive technology more scalable, which can be achieved in the short term by a series of technical improvements.\\
	First, barcodes are currently added at the end of the protocol, which limits a single experiment to the size of the plate (typically 96 cells). As in droplet-based methods or combinatorial indexing methods, adding the barcodes at the start of the protocol would enable the simultaneous processing of multiple pools of cells \cite{Dey2015,Mulqueen2018}.\\
	Similarly, the physical separation of mRNA from genomic DNA is also carried out at the start of the protocol and individually for each cell. Given that it is a time-consuming and expensive process, this step should also be performed after pooling \cite{Dey2015}.\\
	Finally, sequencing costs are substantially decreasing (even faster than predicted by Moore's law \cite{Svensson2018}). Yet, the generation of scNMT-seq libraries remains inexorably expensive. Hence, we anticipate that efforts to decrease the library size by a pre-selection of the genetic material will be indispensable. Examples of such strategies are the digestion by restriction enzymes as in RRBS \cite{Guo2013}, an initial round of ATAC protocol to select open chromatin \cite{Spektor2018} or the pull-down of specific genomic regions using capture probes.

	\item \textbf{Imputation of missing epigenetic data}: because of the low amounts of starting material, single-cell methylation protocols are limited by incomplete CpG coverage \cite{Angermueller2017}. These becomes even more pronounced in scNMT-seq where almost $\approx$ 50\% of CpG dinucleotides are removed to avoid technical biases (see \Cref{section:scnmt_coverage}). Nonetheless, as discussed in \Cref{section:scnmt_protocol}, an important advantage of bisulfite approaches is that missing data can be easily discriminated from inaccessible chromatin. Therefore, the imputation of DNA methylation data will be a critical step to enable genome-wide analysis.\\
	Most of the methods developed for bulk data are unsuccesful because they do not account for cell-to-cell variability \cite{Angermueller2017}. A successful single-cell strategy based on deep learning has been proposed (DeepCpG\cite{Angermueller2017}), but is a complex model that is difficult to train and does not scale to large studies. Faster and accurate Bayesian approaches have also been considered (Melissa \cite{Kapourani2018b}), albeit the model is restricted to small genomic annotations. An interesting direction would be to extend DeepCpG and Melissa to exploit the richness of information in the GpC accessibility data to refine the imputation of CpG measurements.

	\item \textbf{Adding more molecular layers}: the scNMT-seq protocol can be adapted both experimentally and computationally to profile additional molecular layers. From the computational side, one could exploit the sequence information in the libraries to infer copy number variation or single nucleotide variants \cite{Poirion2018,Fan2018,McCarthy2018,Enge2017}. This approach has been successful at delineating the clonal substructure of somatic tissues and at tracking mutational signatures in cancer tissues. In addition, the full length transcript information enables the quantification of splice variants\cite{Huang2017}, allele-specific fractions\cite{Deng2014} and RNA velocity information \cite{LaManno2018}.\\
	From the experimental side, NMT-seq can theoretically be combined with novel single-cell assays that quantify transcription factor binding \cite{Moudgil2019} and histone modifications \cite{Kaya-Okur2019}.
	% Stephen: TF binding using https://doi.org/10.1101/538553 histone modifications using https://doi.org/10.1101/568915 - both in theory could be combined with some future NMTseq

	\item \textbf{Denoising}: in scNMT-seq the CGC positions (27\%) suffer from off-target effects of the GpC methylase \cite{Kelly2012}. In this work we have excluded those measurements to avoid undesired technical variation. Yet, no attempts have been carried to quantify this effect. If small enough, one could denoise the resulting CpG measurements by machine learning techniques that use sequence context information.
	%The readouts from bisulfite sequencing are very sensitive \cite{XX}. 

	\item \textbf{Long reads}: the scNMT-seq libraries that were generated for this study contained short reads (75bp) that do not provide sufficient information about the regional context of the individual DNA molecule. By sequencing NOMe-seq libraries with long-read nanopore sequencing technology \cite{Lee2018} showed that one can obtain phased methylation and chromatin accessibility measurements and structural changes from a single assay. This approach could potentially unveil a more comprehensive understanding of the epigenome dynamics and its regulatory role on RNA expression.

\end{itemize}


% In conclusion, we have shown that the use of non-linear methods for summarising NOMe-seq accessibility data can yield novel insights into the chromatin organisation, nucleosome positioning and the consequent regulation of gene expression. Yet, we acknowledge that this novel computational methodology needs to be further validated using other data sets, and some improvements need to be implemented in order to ensure that robust biological signal can be extracted from single-cell studies. First, the use of faster inference frameworks, which has been implemented in the new version of the software \cite{Kapourani2018}. Second, the method requires a large number of measurements for an accurate regression. In this study we used relatively lenient thresholds and only $\approx$25\% genes passed coverage filtering. An attempt to improve this could be the use of Bayesian methods that simultaneously cluster and fit the regression model, effectively leveraging information about the similarity between individual cells \cite{Kapourani2018b}. Finally, one could aim at learning a joint model with DNA methylation and chromatin accessiblity to provide an extra layer of multi-modal information.
