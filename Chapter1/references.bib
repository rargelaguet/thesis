We discuss some recent findings on one representative epigenetic modification, DNA methylation, in some common diseases. While many new risk factors have been identified through the population-based epigenetic epidemiologic studies on the role of epigenetics in common diseases, this relatively new field still faces many unique challenges. Here, we describe those promises and unique challenges of epigenetic epidemiological studies and propose some potential solutions."

ABSTRACT={DNA methylation is a biochemical process where a DNA base, usually cytosine, is enzymatically methylated at the 5-carbon position. An epigenetic modification associated with gene regulation, DNA methylation is of paramount importance regarding biological health and disease. Recently, the quest to unravel the Human Epigenome commenced, calling for a modernisation of previous DNA methylation profiling techniques. 
Here, we describe the major developments in the methodologies used over the past three decades to examine the elusive epigenome (or methylome). The earliest techniques were based on the separation of methylated and unmethylated cytosines via chromatography. The following years would see molecular techniques being employed to indirectly examine DNA methylation levels at both a genome-wide and locus-specific context, notably immunoprecipitation via anti-5’methylcytosine and selective digestion with methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases. With the advent of sodium bisulphite treatment of DNA, a deamination reaction that converts cytosine to uracil only when unmethylated, the epigenetic modification can be identified in the same manner as a DNA base-pair change. More recently, these three techniques have been applied to more technically advanced  systems such as DNA microarrays and next generation sequencing platforms, bringing us closer to unveiling a complete human epigenetic profile.  While the more recent methods are currently being employed, even newer sequencing platforms and methodologies are being developed to improve our detection of DNA methylation including 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.  The next decade is likely to experience an explosion in the number of completed human methylomes or epigenomes; the challenge will be to work out their functional significance.

Epigenetic reprogramming results in global hypomethylation of the genome together with a profound loss of memory, which underlies naive pluripotency. Such global reprogramming occurs in primordial germ cells, early embryos, and embryonic stem cells where reciprocal molecular links connect the methylation machinery to pluripotency. Priming for differentiation is initiated upon exit from pluripotency, and we propose that epigenetic mechanisms create diversity of transcriptional states, which help with symmetry breaking during cell fate decisions and lineage commitment."

These single-cell multiomics technologies can reveal cellular heterogeneity at multiple molecular layers within a population of cells and reveal how this variation is coupled or uncoupled between the captured omic layers. The data sets generated by these techniques have the potential to enable a deeper understanding of the key biological processes and mechanisms driving cellular heterogeneity and how they are linked with normal development and aging as well as disease etiology.

At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state. Deep sequencing of smRNAs revealed a direct relationship between the location of smRNAs and DNA methylation, perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation, and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in regions of RNA-DNA homology. Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state."

   abstract="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological and chronic inflammatory disease that is mediated by demyelination and axonal degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Studies have shown that immune system components such as CD4+, CD8+, CD44+ T cells, B lymphatic cells, and inflammatory cytokines play a critical role in inflammatory processes and myelin damage associated with MS. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of MS remains poorly defined. DNA methylation, a significant epigenetic modification, is reported to be extensively involved in MS pathogenesis through the regulation of gene expression. This review focuses on DNA methylation involved in MS pathogenesis. Evidence showed the hypermethylation of human leukocyte antigen-DRB1 (HLA-DRB1) in CD4+ T cells, the genome-wide DNA methylation in CD8+ T cells, the hypermethylation of interleukin-4 (IL-4)/forkhead winged helix transcription factor 3 (Foxp3), and the demethylation of interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$)/IL-17a in CD44+ encephalitogenic T cells. Studies also showed the hypermethylation of SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and methylated changes of genes regulating oligodendrocyte and neuronal function in normal-appearing white matter. Clarifying the mechanism of aberrant methylation on MS may explain part of the pathology and will lead to the development of a new therapeutic target for the treatment of MS in the future.",

Cusanovitch et al. skirted previously identified technological limitations to identify regions of accessible chromatin at single-cell resolution. Combinatorial cellular indexing, a strategy for multiplex barcoding of thousands of single cells per experiment, was successfully used to investigate the genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscape in each of over 15,000 single cells.Science, this issue p. 910Technical advances have enabled the collection of genome and transcriptome data sets with single-cell resolution. However, single-cell characterization of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must be physically separated before biochemical processing, conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from more than 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas.},

We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic DNA. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic DNA, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by PCR with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The PCR products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single DNA molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single DNA strands of two closely spaced CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm DNA an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.},

   abstract = {"Probing chromatin structure with DNA methyltransferases offers advantages over more commonly used nuclease-based and chromatin immunoprecipitation methods for detection of nucleosomes and non-histone protein–DNA interactions. Here, we describe two related methods in which the readout of MTase accessibility is obtained by assaying 5-methylcytosine in DNA through the PCR-based technique of bisulfite genomic sequencing. The methyltransferase accessibility protocol (MAP) determines the relative frequency at which the enzyme accesses each of its target sites over an entire population of PCR amplified product. While MAP yields much quantitative information about relative accessibility of a region of chromatin, a complementary single-molecule view of methyltransferase accessibility, termed MAP for individual templates (MAP-IT), is provided by analysis of cloned PCR products. Absolute rather than relative methylation frequencies in a region are obtained by summing the methylation status at each site over a cohort of clones. Moreover, as the integrity of individual molecules is maintained in MAP-IT, unique information about the distribution of multiple footprints along continuous regions is gleaned. In principle, the population MAP and single-molecule MAP-IT strategies can be used to analyze chromatin structure in a variety of model systems. Here, we describe the application of MAP in living Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and MAP-IT in the analysis of a mammalian tumor suppressor gene in nuclei. This application of MAP-IT provides the first means to simultaneously determine CpG methylation of mammalian genes and their overlying chromatin structure in the same single DNA molecule."}

Such stochasticity in transcription increases the heterogeneity among cells and likely contributes to the phenotypic variance among individuals of identical genotype. Expression from both alleles is generally observed in analyses of diploid cell populations, but studies addressing allelic expression patterns genome-wide in single cells are lacking. Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across individual cells of mouse preimplantation embryos of mixed background (CAST/EiJ {\texttimes} C57BL/6J). We discovered abundant (12 to 24\%) monoallelic expression of autosomal genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation of the paternal X chromosome. We conclude that independent and stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random monoallelic expression in the mammalian cell.},

   High-throughput sequencing has allowed for unprecedented detail in gene expression analyses, yet its efficient application to single cells is challenged by the small starting amounts of RNA. We have developed CEL-Seq, a method for overcoming this limitation by barcoding and pooling samples before linearly amplifying mRNA with the use of one round of in vitro transcription. We show that CEL-Seq gives more reproducible, linear, and sensitive results than a PCR-based amplification method. We demonstrate the power of this method by studying early C. elegans embryonic development at single-cell resolution. Differential distribution of transcripts between sister cells is seen as early as the two-cell stage embryo, and zygotic expression in the somatic cell lineages is enriched for transcription factors. The robust transcriptome quantifications enabled by CEL-Seq will be useful for transcriptomic analyses of complex tissues containing populations of diverse cell types."

We find that embryonic stem cells, but not somatic tissues, have significant cytosine-5 methylation at CpA and, to a lesser extent, at CpT. As the expression of the de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3a correlates well with the presence of non-CpG methylation, we asked whether Dnmt3a might be responsible for this modification. Analysis of genomic methylation in transgenic Drosophila expressing Dnmt3a reveals that Dnmt3a is predominantly a CpG methylase but also is able to induce methylation at CpA and at CpT. 5mC,5-methylcytosine;ES cells,embryonic stem cells;Dnmt,DNA methyltransferase;NNA,nearest neighbor analysis},

   abstract = { DNA methylation is a chemical modification that occurs predominantly on CG dinucleotides in mammalian genomes. However, recent studies have revealed that non-CG methylation (mCH) is abundant and nonrandomly distributed in the genomes of pluripotent cells and brain cells, and is present at lower levels in many other human cells and tissues. Surprisingly, mCH in pluripotent cells is distinct from that in brain cells in terms of sequence specificity and association with transcription, indicating the existence of different mCH pathways. In addition, several recent studies have begun to reveal the biological significance of mCH in diverse cellular processes. In reprogrammed somatic cells, mCH marks megabase-scale regions that have failed to revert to the pluripotent epigenetic state. In myocytes, promoter mCH accumulation is associated with the transcriptional response to environmental factors. In brain cells, mCH accumulates during the establishment of neural circuits and is associated with Rett syndrome. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of mCH and its possible functional consequences in different biological contexts. }

An advantage of scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss, which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of CTCF binding events and to estimate the average nucleosome phasing distances in single cells. scNOMe-seq is therefore well-suited to characterize the chromatin organization of single cells in heterogeneous cellular mixtures.},

   abstract = "Summary
   Methods for single-cell genome and transcriptome sequencing have contributed to our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, whereas methods for single-cell epigenomics are much less established. Here, we describe a whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) assay that enables DNA methylation mapping in very small cell populations (μWGBS) and single cells (scWGBS). Our assay is optimized for profiling many samples at low coverage, and we describe a bioinformatic method that analyzes collections of single-cell methylomes to infer cell-state dynamics. Using these technological advances, we studied epigenomic cell-state dynamics in three in vitro models of cellular differentiation and pluripotency, where we observed characteristic patterns of epigenome remodeling and cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The described method enables single-cell analysis of DNA methylation in a broad range of biological systems, including embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, and cancer. It can also be used to establish composite methylomes that account for cell-to-cell heterogeneity in complex tissue samples."

    abstract = "{DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification in many species that is critical for development, and implicated in ageing and many complex diseases, such as cancer. Many cost-effective genome-wide analyses of DNA modifications rely on restriction enzymes capable of digesting genomic DNA at defined sequence motifs. There are hundreds of restriction enzyme families but few are used to date, because no tool is available for the systematic evaluation of restriction enzyme combinations that can enrich for certain sites of interest in a genome. Herein, we present customised Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (cuRRBS), a novel and easy-to-use computational method that solves this problem. By computing the optimal enzymatic digestions and size selection steps required, cuRRBS generalises the traditional MspI-based Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) protocol to all restriction enzyme combinations. In addition, cuRRBS estimates the fold-reduction in sequencing costs and provides a robustness value for the personalised RRBS protocol, allowing users to tailor the protocol to their experimental needs. Moreover, we show in silico that cuRRBS-defined restriction enzymes consistently out-perform MspI digestion in many biological systems, considering both CpG and CHG contexts. Finally, we have validated the accuracy of cuRRBS predictions for single and double enzyme digestions using two independent experimental datasets.}",

In this review, we provide an overview of such omics technologies and focus on methods for their integration across multiple omics layers.

Systematic characterization of cancer genomes has revealed a staggering number of diverse aberrations that differ among individuals, such that the functional importance and physiological impact of most tumor genetic alterations remain poorly defined. We developed a computational framework that integrates chromosomal copy number and gene expression data for detecting aberrations that promote cancer progression. We demonstrate the utility of this framework using a melanoma data set. Our analysis correctly identified known drivers of melanoma and predicted multiple tumor dependencies. Two dependencies, TBC1D16 and RAB27A, confirmed empirically, suggest that abnormal regulation of protein trafficking contributes to proliferation in melanoma. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of integrative Bayesian approaches to identify candidate drivers with biological, and possibly therapeutic, importance in cancer."

   We applied a combinatorial indexing assay, sci-ATAC-seq, to profile genome-wide chromatin accessibility in ∼100,000 single cells from 13 adult mouse tissues. We identify 85 distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility, most of which can be assigned to cell types, and ∼400,000 differentially accessible elements. We use these data to link regulatory elements to their target genes, to define the transcription factor grammar specifying each cell type, and to discover in vivo correlates of heterogeneity in accessibility within cell types. We develop a technique for mapping single cell gene expression data to single-cell chromatin accessibility data, facilitating the comparison of atlases. By intersecting mouse chromatin accessibility with human genome-wide association summary statistics, we identify cell-type-specific enrichments of the heritability signal for hundreds of complex traits. These data define the in vivo landscape of the regulatory genome for common mammalian cell types at single-cell resolution."

The original implementation has been enhanced in two important ways: we introduced a fast, variational inference approach that enables the quantification of Bayesian posterior confidence measures on the model, and we adapted the method to use several observation models, making it suitable for a diverse range of platforms including single-cell analyses and methylation arrays.http://bioconductor.org/packages/BPRMethSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Yet, intrinsic limitations of the technology result in very sparse coverage of CpG sites (around 5\% to 20\% coverage), effectively limiting the analysis repertoire to a semi-quantitative level. Here we introduce Melissa (MEthyLation Inference for Single cell Analysis), a Bayesian hierarchical method to quantify spatially-varying methylation profiles across genomic regions from single-cell bisulfite sequencing data (scBS-seq). Melissa clusters individual cells based on local methylation patterns, enabling the discovery of epigenetic differences and similarities among individual cells. The clustering also acts as an effective regularisation method for imputation of methylation on unassayed CpG sites, enabling transfer of information between individual cells. We show both on simulated and real data sets that Melissa provides accurate and biologically meaningful clusterings, and state-of-the-art imputation performance. An R implementation of Melissa is publicly available at https://github.com/andreaskapou/Melissa.},

Recently implemented multi–omics measurements of genomes, transcriptomes, epigenomes, proteomes and chromatin organization are opening up new avenues to begin to disentangle the causal relationship between -omics layers and how these co-determine higher-order cellular phenotypes. This technological revolution is not restricted to basic science but promises major breakthroughs in medical diagnostics and treatments. In this paper we review existing computational methods for the analysis and integration of different -omics layers and discuss what new approaches are needed to leverage the full potential of single cell multi-omics data."

The approaches presented here constitute the forefront of epigenetics research at the single-cell level using classic and innovative methods to dissect epigenetics mechanisms from the limited material available in a single cell.

  abstract = "Human influenza A viruses (IAVs) cause global pandemics and
              epidemics. These viruses evolve rapidly, making current treatment
              options ineffective. To identify novel modulators of IAV-host
              interactions, we re-analyzed our recent transcriptomics,
              metabolomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and genomics/virtual
              ligand screening data. We identified 713 potential modulators
              targeting 199 cellular and two viral proteins. Anti-influenza
              activity for 48 of them has been reported previously, whereas the
              antiviral efficacy of the 665 remains unknown. Studying
              anti-influenza efficacy and immuno/neuro-modulating properties of
              these compounds and their combinations as well as potential viral
              and host resistance to them may lead to the discovery of novel
              modulators of IAV-host interactions, which might be more
              effective than the currently available anti-influenza
              therapeutics.",
