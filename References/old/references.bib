  abstract  = "SummaryA highly multiplexed cytometric imaging approach, termed
               co-detection by indexing (CODEX), is used here to create
               multiplexed datasets of normal and lupus (MRL/lpr) murine
               spleens. CODEX iteratively visualizes antibody binding events
               using DNA barcodes, fluorescent dNTP analogs, and an in situ
               polymerization-based indexing procedure. An algorithmic pipeline
               for single-cell antigen quantification in tightly packed tissues
               was developed and used to overlay well-known morphological
               features with de novo characterization of lymphoid tissue
               architecture at a single-cell and cellular neighborhood levels.
               We observed an unexpected, profound impact of the cellular
               neighborhood on the expression of protein receptors on immune
               cells. By comparing normal murine spleen to spleens from animals
               with systemic autoimmune disease (MRL/lpr), extensive and
               previously uncharacterized splenic cell-interaction dynamics in
               the healthy versus diseased state was observed. The fidelity of
               multiplexed spatial cytometry demonstrated here allows for
               quantitative systemic characterization of tissue architecture in
               normal and clinically aberrant samples.",

              becoming an increasingly important complement to other gene
              expression analysis methods. Especially important for long
              noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), RNA FISH adds the ability to
              distinguish between primary and mature lncRNA transcripts and
              thus to segregate the site of synthesis from the site of
              action.We detail a streamlined RNA FISH protocol for the
              simultaneous imaging of multiple primary and mature mRNA and
              lncRNA gene products and RNA variants in fixed mammalian cells.
              The technique makes use of fluorescently pre-labeled, short DNA
              oligonucleotides (circa 20 nucleotides in length), pooled into
              sets of up to 48 individual probes. The overall binding of
              multiple oligonucleotides to the same RNA target results in
              fluorescent signals that reveal clusters of RNAs or single RNA
              molecules as punctate spots without the need for enzymatic signal
              amplification. Visualization of these punctate signals, through
              the use of wide-field fluorescence microscopy, enables the
              counting of single transcripts down to one copy per cell.
              Additionally, by using probe sets with spectrally distinct
              fluorophores, multiplex analysis of gene-specific RNAs, or RNA
              variants, can be achieved. The presented examples illustrate how
              this method can add temporospatial information between the
              transcription event and both the location and the endurance of
              the mature lncRNA. We also briefly discuss post-processing of
              images and spot counting to demonstrate the capabilities of this
              method for the statistical analysis of RNA molecules per cell.
              This information can be utilized to determine both overall gene
              expression levels and cell-to-cell gene expression variation.",

              community we are seeing a shift in paradigms from the traditional
              neurocentric view to that of a more dynamic, integrated one where
              astrocytes are no longer considered as being just supportive, and
              activated microglia have a profound influence. Lactate is
              emerging as the ``good guy,'' contrasting its classical ``bad
              guy'' position in the now superseded medical literature. This
              review begins with the evolution of the concept of ``lactate
              shuttles''; goes on to the recent shift in ideas regarding normal
              neuroenergetics (homeostasis)-specifically, the astrocyte-neuron
              lactate shuttle; and progresses to covering the metabolic
              implications whereby homeostasis is lost-a state of allostasis,
              and the function of microglia. The role of lactate, as a
              substrate and shuttle, is reviewed in light of allostatic stress,
              and beyond-in an acute state of allostatic stress in terms of

              persistent stress as allostatic overload-neurodegenerative
              diseases. Finally, the recently proposed astrocyte-microglia
              lactate shuttle is discussed in terms of chronic
              neuroinflammatory infectious diseases, using tuberculous
              meningitis as an example. The novelty extended by this review is
              that the directionality of lactate, as shuttles in the brain, in
              neuropathophysiological states is emerging as crucial in

               changes in the levels and in the distribution of cathepsins in
               the brain of this mouse model. Cathepsin mRNA expression was
               significantly elevated by up to ∼10-fold, with the time-course
               of the increase correlating with the progression of disease
               severity. Cathepsin activity and protein levels were also
               elevated. Significant changes in cathepsin D distribution in the
               brain were detected, with cathepsin D elevated in areas where
               neuronal loss, astrogliosis and microgliosis were observed, such
               as in layer V of the cerebral cortex, the lateral globus

               cathepsins in the neuropathology of neuronal forms of GD and of
               other lysosomal storage diseases, and are consistent with a

               contribute to stroke and dementia pathology, but the mechanisms
               are poorly understood. Phagocytic removal of neurons is
               generally assumed to be beneficial and to occur only after
               neuronal death. However, we report herein that inhibition of
               phagocytosis can prevent delayed loss and death of functional
               neurons after transient brain ischemia. Two phagocytic proteins,
               Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MerTK) and Milk fat globule
               EGF-like factor 8 (MFG-E8), were transiently up-regulated by
               macrophages/microglia after focal brain ischemia in vivo.
               Strikingly, deficiency in either protein completely prevented
               long-term functional motor deficits after cerebral ischemia and
               strongly reduced brain atrophy as a result of inhibiting
               phagocytosis of neurons. Correspondingly, in vitro
               glutamate-stressed neurons reversibly exposed the ``eat-me''
               signal phosphatidylserine, leading to their phagocytosis by
               microglia; this neuronal loss was prevented in the absence of
               microglia and reduced if microglia were genetically deficient in
               MerTK or MFG-E8, both of which mediate
               phosphatidylserine-recognition. Thus, phagocytosis of viable
               neurons contributes to brain pathology and, surprisingly,
               blocking this process is strongly beneficial. Therefore,
               inhibition of specific phagocytic pathways may present
               therapeutic targets for preventing delayed neuronal loss after
               transient cerebral ischemia.",

              vitronectin receptor (VR) on phagocytes. However, we show here
              that MFG-E8 can mediate phagocytosis of viable neurons during
              neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thereby
              causing neuronal death. In vitro, inflammatory neuronal loss is
              independent of apoptotic pathways, and is inhibited by blocking
              the PS/MFG-E8/VR pathway (by adding PS blocking antibodies,

              Neuronal loss is absent in Mfge8 knock-out cultures, but restored

              membrane protein in paranodal loops. Mouse Opalin is composed of
              a short N-terminal extracellular domain (amino acid residues
              1-30), a transmembrane domain (residues 31-53), and a long

              showed that myelin Opalin contained N- and O-glycans, and that

              identified two N-glycan sites at Asn-6 and Asn-12 and an O-glycan
              site at Thr-14 in the extracellular domain. Site-directed
              mutations at the glycan sites impaired the cell surface

              myelinated axons in a spiral fashion, and was concentrated in the

              physiological consequences of this glial transmitter release on
              brain information processing remain poorly understood. We
              demonstrate here in hippocampal slices of 2- to 5-week-old rats
              that glutamate released from glial cells generates slow transient
              currents (STCs) mediated by the activation of NMDA receptors in
              pyramidal cells. STCs persist in the absence of neuronal and
              synaptic activity, indicating a nonsynaptic origin of the source
              of glutamate. Indeed, STCs occur spontaneously but can also be
              induced by pharmacological tools known to activate astrocytes and
              by the selective mechanical stimulation of single nearby glial
              cells. Bath application of the inhibitor of the glutamate uptake
              dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate increases both the frequency of
              STCs and the amplitude of a tonic conductance mediated by NMDA
              receptors and probably also originated from glial glutamate
              release. By using dual recordings, we observed synchronized STCs
              in pyramidal cells having their soma distant by <100 microm. The
              degree of precision (<100 msec) of this synchronization rules out
              the involvement of calcium waves spreading through the glial
              network. It also indicates that single glial cells release
              glutamate onto adjacent neuronal processes, thereby controlling
              simultaneously the excitability of several neighboring pyramidal
              cells. In conclusion, our results show that the glial glutamate

              reuptake into the nerve terminals from which they are released,
              or by uptake into adjacent cells. A family of more than 20
              transporter proteins is involved. In addition to the plasma
              membrane transporters, vesicular transporters in the membranes of
              neurotransmitter storage vesicles are responsible for maintaining
              vesicle stores and facilitating exocytotic neurotransmitter
              release. The cell membrane monoamine transporters are important
              targets for CNS drugs. The transporters for noradrenaline and
              serotonin are key targets for antidepressant drugs. Both
              noradrenaline-selective and serotonin-selective reuptake
              inhibitors are effective against major depression and a range of
              other psychiatric illnesses. As the newer drugs are safer in
              overdose than the first-generation tricyclic antidepressants,
              their use has greatly expanded. The dopamine transporter (DAT) is
              a key target for amphetamine and methylphenidate, used in the
              treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
              Psychostimulant drugs of abuse (amphetamines and cocaine) also
              target DAT. The amino-acid neurotransmitters are inactivated by
              other families of neurotransmitter transporters, mainly located
              on astrocytes and other non-neural cells. Although there are many

              accurate mitotic count using a defined field area. A numerical

              better survival than those with grade II and III tumours (P less

  abstract  = "Author Summary Daily interactions between individuals can
               influence their health both in positive and negative ways. Often
               the mechanisms mediating social effects are unknown, so current
               approaches to study social effects are limited to a few
               phenotypes for which the mediating mechanisms are known a priori
               or suspected. Here we propose to leverage the fact that most
               traits are genetically controlled to investigate the influence
               of the social environment. To do so, we study associations
               between genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another
               individual (social genetic effects, SGE, also called indirect
               genetic effects). Importantly, SGE can be studied even when the
               traits that mediate the influence of the social environment are
               not known. For the first time we quantified the contribution of
               SGE to more than 100 organismal phenotypes and genome-wide gene
               expression measured in laboratory mice. We find that genetic
               variation in cage mates (i.e. SGE) explains up to 29\% of the
               variation in anxiety, wound healing, immune function, and body
               weight. Hence our study uncovers an unexpectedly large influence
               of the social environment. Additionally, we show that ignoring
               SGE can severely bias estimates of direct genetic effects
               (effects of an individual's genotypes on its own phenotype),
               which has important implications for the study of the genetic
               basis of complex traits.",

  abstract  = "Segmentation is the process of partitioning digital images into
               meaningful regions. The analysis of biological high content
               images often requires segmentation as a first step. We propose
               ilastik as an easy-to-use tool which allows the user without
               expertise in image processing to perform segmentation and
               classification in a unified way. ilastik learns from labels
               provided by the user through a convenient mouse interface. Based
               on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation.
               A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in
               which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of
               generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three
               spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all
               dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime
               feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the
               segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier.
               An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in
               the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading
               which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core
               machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of
               representative images, it can be exported and used to
               automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using

               and functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient.
               Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been
               linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume
               that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively
               isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven
               problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach.
               Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular
               signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and
               leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically
               defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data.
               PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic
               blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state.
               Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based
               measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene
               expression signature that was predictive of survival in
               independent cohorts. This study presents new methods for
               large-scale analysis of single-cell heterogeneity and
               demonstrates their utility, yielding insights into AML

               calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely

               equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is

              implement only a very specific range of tasks to optimize the
              necessary computations. Here, we present a multi-trait modeling
              framework that is versatile and fast: LIMIX enables to flexibly
              adapt mixed models for a broad range of applications with
              different observed and hidden covariates, and variable study
              designs. To highlight the novel modeling aspects of LIMIX we

              correlated blood lipid phenotypes, joint analysis of the

              integrating stepwise multi-locus regression into multi-trait
              models, and when analyzing large numbers of traits. An open

              for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits.
              Current methods partition the total heritability by jointly
              estimating the contributions of all regions. However, these
              methods are computationally intractable and can be inaccurate
              when the number of regions is large. In this paper, we present an
              alternative approach that partitions the total heritability into
              the contributions of an arbitrary number of regions. We
              demonstrate by using simulations that our approach is more
              accurate and computationally efficient than current approaches.
              Using a data set from a genome-wide association study on human
              height, we demonstrate the utility of our method by estimating
              the heritability contributions of chromosomes and subchromosomal
              regions.",

                   is dense in the family of bounded positive semi-definite
                   functions (i.e. can approximate any bounded kernel with
                   arbitrary precision). We start by discussing the case of
                   stationary kernels, and propose a family of spectral kernels
                   that extends existing approaches such as spectral mixture
                   kernels and sparse spectrum kernels. Our extension has two
                   primary advantages. Firstly, unlike existing spectral
                   approaches that yield infinite differentiability, the
                   kernels we introduce allow learning the degree of
                   differentiability of the latent function in Gaussian process
                   (GP) models and functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert
                   space (RKHS) in other kernel methods. Secondly, we show that
                   some of the kernels we propose require fewer parameters than
                   existing spectral kernels for the same accuracy, thereby
                   leading to faster and more robust inference. Finally, we

                   family of spectral kernels that we prove can approximate any

  abstract   = "Kernel methods are ubiquitous tools in machine learning. They
                have proven to be effective in many domains and tasks. Yet,
                kernel methods often require the user to select a predefined
                kernel to build an estimator with. However, there is often
                little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a
                priori. Even if a universal approximating kernel is selected,
                the quality of the finite sample estimator may be greatly
                affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore, when directly
                applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a N
                \textbackslashtimes N Gram matrix of pairwise kernel
                evaluations to work with a dataset of N instances. The
                computation of this Gram matrix precludes the direct
                application of kernel methods on large datasets, and makes
                kernel learning especially difficult. In this paper we
                introduce Bayesian nonparmetric kernel-learning (BaNK), a
                generic, data-driven framework for scalable learning of
                kernels. BaNK places a nonparametric prior on the spectral
                distribution of random frequencies allowing it to both learn
                kernels and scale to large datasets. We show that this
                framework can be used for large scale regression and
                classification tasks. Furthermore, we show that BaNK
                outperforms several other scalable approaches for kernel
                learning on a variety of real world datasets.",

              Teregowda): In recent years, a variety of nonlinear
              dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, many of
              which rely on the evaluation of local properties of the data. The
              paper presents a review and systematic comparison of these
              techniques. The performances of the techniques are investigated
              on artificial and natural tasks. The results of the experiments
              reveal that nonlinear techniques perform well on selected

              real-world tasks. The paper explains these results by identifying
              weaknesses of current nonlinear techniques, and suggests how the
              performance of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques may
              be improved.",

               series of environmental input variables. Non-linear regression
               using `neural networks' is a popular technique for such modeling
               tasks. Since it is not obvious how large a time-window of inputs
               is appropriate, or what preprocessing of inputs is best, this
               can be viewed as a regression problem in which there are many
               possible input variables, some of which may actually be
               irrelevant to the prediction of the output variable. Because a
               finite data set will show random correlations between the
               irrelevant inputs and the output, any conventional neural
               network (even with regularisation or `weight decay') will not
               set the coefficients for these junk inputs to zero. Thus the
               irrelevant variables will hurt the model's performance. The

  abstract = "The independent component analysis (ICA) of a random vector
              consists of searching for a linear transformation that minimizes
              the statistical dependence between its components. In order to
              define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual
              information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing
              orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the
              computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time.
              The concept of ICA may actually be seen as an extension of the
              principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose
              independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines
              directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA
              include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection,
              localization of sources, and blind identification and
              deconvolution. Zusammenfassung Die Analyse unabh{\"a}ngiger

              zwischen den Komponenten minimiert. Zur Definition geeigneter
              Such-Kriterien wird die Entwicklung gemeinsamer Information als
              Funktion von Kumulanten steigender Ordnung genutzt. Es wird ein
              effizienter Algorithmus vorgeschlagen, der die Berechnung der ICA
              f{\"u}r Datenmatrizen innerhalb einer polynomischen Zeit erlaubt.
              Das Konzept der ICA kann eigentlich als Erweiterung der
              `Principal Component Analysis` (PCA) betrachtet werden, die nur
              die Unabh{\"a}ngigkeit bis zur zweiten Ordnung erzwingen kann und
              deshalb Richtungen definiert, die orthogonal sind. Potentielle
              Anwendungen der ICA beinhalten Daten-Analyse und Kompression,

              transform the original graphical model into a simplified
              graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the
              simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in
              the original model. We describe a general framework for
              generating variational transformations based on convex duality.

  abstract      = "This paper presents a new deterministic approximation
                   technique in Bayesian networks. This method, ``Expectation
                   Propagation'', unifies two previous techniques:
                   assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman
                   filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief
                   propagation in Bayesian networks. All three algorithms try
                   to recover an approximate distribution which is close in KL
                   divergence to the true distribution. Loopy belief
                   propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is
                   useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those
                   which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation
                   approximates the belief states by only retaining certain
                   expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until
                   these expectations are consistent throughout the network.
                   This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete
                   and continuous nodes. Expectation Propagation also extends
                   belief propagation in the opposite direction - it can
                   propagate richer belief states that incorporate correlations
                   between nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show
                   Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better than
                   methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method,
                   variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation

                   a flexible approach for non-linear dimensionality reduction
                   that has been widely applied. However, the current approach
                   for training GP-LVMs is based on maximum likelihood, where
                   the latent projection variables are maximized over rather
                   than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian
                   method for training GP-LVMs by introducing a non-standard
                   variational inference framework that allows to approximately
                   integrate out the latent variables and subsequently train a
                   GP-LVM by maximizing an analytic lower bound on the exact
                   marginal likelihood. We apply this method for learning a
                   GP-LVM from iid observations and for learning non-linear
                   dynamical systems where the observations are temporally

                   ability to automatically select the dimensionality of the

                   Gaussian process regression with uncertain inputs and

              suitable computational approaches are developed. One key
              challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing
              populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of
              each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five established
              supervised machine learning methods and a custom-built predictor
              for allocating cells to their cell-cycle stage on the basis of
              their transcriptome. In particular, we assess the impact of
              different normalisation strategies and the usage of prior
              knowledge on the predictive power of the classifiers. We tested
              the methods on previously published datasets and found that a
              PCA-based approach and the custom predictor performed best.
              Moreover, our analysis shows that the performance depends
              strongly on normalisation and the usage of prior knowledge. Only
              by leveraging prior knowledge in form of cell-cycle annotated
              genes and by preprocessing the data using a rank-based
              normalisation, is it possible to robustly capture the
              transcriptional cell-cycle signature across different cell types,
              organisms and experimental protocols.",

  author   = "Meugnier, Emmanuelle and Rome, Sophie and Vidal, Hubert",
  abstract = "PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: In addition to its metabolic function,
              glucose modulates gene expression which is crucial in adapting
              cells to variations in glycaemia. We summarize recent advances in
              our understanding of regulation of gene expression by glucose.
              RECENT FINDINGS: In-vivo and in-vitro experiments demonstrated
              that glucose regulates the transcription of genes encoding not
              only lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes but also proteins involved
              in global cell functions. The molecular mechanisms have begun to
              be elucidated, and the transcription factor carbohydrate
              responsive element-binding protein has emerged as a key actor, at
              least in liver. More recently, other candidates have been
              proposed, such as liver X receptors. In pathological situations,
              altered glycaemic control, as observed in diabetes mellitus, is
              associated with increased risk for microvascular and
              macrovascular complications. Recent findings suggest that changes
              in gene expression occurring in response to hyperglycaemia
              represent a novel component of glucotoxicity. SUMMARY: Until
              recently, the direct transcriptional effects of glucose were
              underestimated, and insulin was considered to be the major
              regulator of gene expression in response to glycaemic variation.
              The recent discovery and characterization of transcription
              factors mediating the glucose response demonstrate that glucose,
              like fatty acids and other key nutrients, can directly control
              gene expression.",

               cells, they consist of non-transformed host stromal cells such
               as endothelial cells, fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. All of
               these cells are embedded in a characteristic extracellular
               matrix and are surrounded by specific molecular and metabolic
               microenvironments. Blood and lymphatic vessels, which are
               important for maintaining the homeostasis of living organisms,
               are compromised in solid tumors, causing various physiological
               barriers to the delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors in
               sufficient quantity and under optimal conditions. There is a
               growing body of evidence that stromal cells are not quiescent
               bystanders; instead, they significantly influence the
               pathophysiology of tumors. Both stromal cells and tumor cells
               participate in the formation of this milieu, and the
               microenvironment, which includes the expression of positive and
               negative regulators of angiogenesis, influences the biology of
               these cells. Any of these factors --- tumor cells, stromal
               cells, and the local microenvironment of particular organs ---
               may vary during treatment and may influence the efficiency of
               various treatment modalities. Therefore, stromal cells and the
               tumor microenvironment offer novel targets for tumor detection
               and treatment. A better understanding of host-tumor interaction
               and formation, as well as of the function of blood and lymphatic
               vessels in tumors in different microenvironments, is warranted
               in order to facilitate the development of such strategies.",

               of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical
               sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity
               that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to
               individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety
               of downstream analyses, including identification of sample
               subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples.
               We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic
               lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA
               expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA
               identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including
               immunoglobulin heavy‐chain variable region status, trisomy of
               chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as
               response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used
               MOFA to analyse single‐cell multi‐omics data, identifying
               coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell
               differentiation. ![][1] Multi‐Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) is a

                   process is a challenging problem in systems biology. A
                   mechanical model of the regulatory process needs to be able
                   to describe the available spatio-temporal protein
                   concentration and mRNA expression data and recover the
                   continuous spatio-temporal fields. Rigorous methods are
                   required to identify model parameters. A promising approach
                   to deal with these difficulties is proposed using Gaussian
                   process as a prior distribution over the latent function of

                   operators at stake are linear, the information from the
                   physical model can be encoded into the kernel function.

               the pairwise similarity between every two individuals in a

               controls fundamental, dynamic biological processes is important
               for determining normal cellular function and potential
               perturbations that might give rise to physiological disorders.
               Ideally, investigations would employ time series experiments to
               periodically measure the properties of each cell. This would
               allow us to understand the sequence of gene (in)activations that
               constitute the program being followed. In practice, such
               experiments can be difficult to perform as cellular activity may
               be asynchronous with each cell occupying a different phase of
               the process of interested. Furthermore, the unbiased measurement
               of all transcripts or proteins requires the cells to be captured
               and lysed precluding the continued monitoring of that cell. In
               the absence of the ability to conduct true time series
               experiments, pseudotime algorithms exploit the asynchronous
               cellular nature of these systems to mathematically assign a
               ``pseudotime'' to each cell based on its molecular profile
               allowing the cells to be aligned and the sequence of gene
               activation events retrospectively inferred. Existing approaches
               predominantly use deterministic methods that ignore the

               We introduce a novel decomposition of the covariance function as

              framework, variancePartition, to prioritize drivers of variation
              based on a genome-wide summary, and identify genes that deviate
              from the genome-wide trend. Using a linear mixed model,
              variancePartition quantifies variation in each expression trait

              functions of these variables which, in some sense, effectively

                   approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This
                   problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics,
                   which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a
                   calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper,
                   we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine
                   learning that approximates probability densities through
                   optimization. VI has been used in many applications and
                   tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov
                   chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first
                   posit a family of densities and then to find the member of
                   that family which is close to the target. Closeness is
                   measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas

                   case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a

                   derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale
                   up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and

               at the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels.
               Genomic profiling at these multiple levels should allow an
               integrated characterization of tumor etiology. However, there is
               a shortage of effective statistical and bioinformatic tools for
               truly integrative data analysis. The standard approach to
               integrative clustering is separate clustering followed by manual
               integration. A more statistically powerful approach would
               incorporate all data types simultaneously and generate a single
               integrated cluster assignment.Methods: We developed a joint
               latent variable model for integrative clustering. We call the
               resulting methodology iCluster. iCluster incorporates flexible
               modeling of the associations between different data types and
               the variance--covariance structure within data types in a single
               framework, while simultaneously reducing the dimensionality of
               the datasets. Likelihood-based inference is obtained through the
               Expectation--Maximization algorithm.Results: We demonstrate the
               iCluster algorithm using two examples of joint analysis of copy
               number and gene expression data, one from breast cancer and one
               from lung cancer. In both cases, we identified subtypes
               characterized by concordant DNA copy number changes and gene
               expression as well as unique profiles specific to one or the
               other in a completely automated fashion. In addition, the

              biological response is key to understanding off-target and
              unexpected drug effects, and for developing hypotheses on how to
              tailor drug therapies. New methods are required for integrated
              analyses of a large number of chemical features of drugs against
              the corresponding genome-wide responses of multiple cell models.
              RESULTS: In this article, we present the first comprehensive
              multi-set analysis on how the chemical structure of drugs impacts
              on genome-wide gene expression across several cancer cell lines
              [Connectivity Map (CMap) database]. The task is formulated as
              searching for drug response components across multiple cancers to
              reveal shared effects of drugs and the chemical features that may
              be responsible. The components can be computed with an extension
              of a recent approach called Group Factor Analysis. We identify 11
              components that link the structural descriptors of drugs with
              specific gene expression responses observed in the three cell
              lines and identify structural groups that may be responsible for
              the responses. Our method quantitatively outperforms the limited
              earlier methods on CMap and identifies both the previously
              reported associations and several interesting novel findings, by
              taking into account multiple cell lines and advanced 3D
              structural descriptors. The novel observations include:
              previously unknown similarities in the effects induced by
              15-delta prostaglandin J2 and HSP90 inhibitors, which are linked
              to the 3D descriptors of the drugs; and the induction by

              discover cancer subtypes and their molecular drivers in a
              comprehensive genetic context. Curtis et al. [Nature (2012)
              486(7403):346-352] has recently shown that integrative clustering
              of copy number and gene expression in 2,000 breast tumors reveals
              novel subgroups beyond the classic expression subtypes that show
              distinct clinical outcomes. To extend the scope of integrative
              analysis for the inclusion of somatic mutation data by massively
              parallel sequencing, we propose a framework for joint modeling of
              discrete and continuous variables that arise from integrated
              genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling. The core idea
              is motivated by the hypothesis that diverse molecular phenotypes
              can be predicted by a set of orthogonal latent variables that
              represent distinct molecular drivers, and thus can reveal tumor
              subgroups of biological and clinical importance. Using the cancer
              cell line encyclopedia dataset, we demonstrate our method can
              accurately group cell lines by their cell-of-origin for several
              cancer types, and precisely pinpoint their known and potential
              cancer driver genes. Our integrative analysis also demonstrates
              the power for revealing subgroups that are not lineage-dependent,
              but consist of different cancer types driven by a common genetic
              alteration. Application of the cancer genome atlas colorectal

              propose a novel generative approach for biclustering called
              'FABIA: Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition'. FABIA is
              based on a multiplicative model, which accounts for linear
              dependencies between gene expression and conditions, and also
              captures heavy-tailed distributions as observed in real-world

              well-founded model selection methods and to apply Bayesian
              techniques. RESULTS: On 100 simulated datasets with known true,
              artificially implanted biclusters, FABIA clearly outperformed all
              11 competitors. On these datasets, FABIA was able to separate
              spurious biclusters from true biclusters by ranking biclusters

              at the genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels.
              Genomic profiling at these multiple levels should allow an
              integrated characterization of tumor etiology. However, there is
              a shortage of effective statistical and bioinformatic tools for
              truly integrative data analysis. The standard approach to
              integrative clustering is separate clustering followed by manual
              integration. A more statistically powerful approach would
              incorporate all data types simultaneously and generate a single
              integrated cluster assignment. METHODS: We developed a joint
              latent variable model for integrative clustering. We call the
              resulting methodology iCluster. iCluster incorporates flexible
              modeling of the associations between different data types and the
              variance-covariance structure within data types in a single
              framework, while simultaneously reducing the dimensionality of
              the datasets. Likelihood-based inference is obtained through the
              Expectation-Maximization algorithm. RESULTS: We demonstrate the
              iCluster algorithm using two examples of joint analysis of copy
              number and gene expression data, one from breast cancer and one
              from lung cancer. In both cases, we identified subtypes

              which aims to study the relationships between several sets of

              components are likely to be affected by the usefulness and

              discover cancer subtypes and their molecular drivers in a
              comprehensive genetic context. Curtis et al. [Nature (2012)
              486(7403):346-352] has recently shown that integrative clustering
              of copy number and gene expression in 2,000 breast tumors reveals
              novel subgroups beyond the classic expression subtypes that show
              distinct clinical outcomes. To extend the scope of integrative
              analysis for the inclusion of somatic mutation data by massively
              parallel sequencing, we propose a framework for joint modeling of
              discrete and continuous variables that arise from integrated
              genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling. The core idea
              is motivated by the hypothesis that diverse molecular phenotypes

              represent distinct molecular drivers, and thus can reveal tumor
              subgroups of biological and clinical importance. Using the cancer
              cell line encyclopedia dataset, we demonstrate our method can
              accurately group cell lines by their cell-of-origin for several
              cancer types, and precisely pinpoint their known and potential
              cancer driver genes. Our integrative analysis also demonstrates
              the power for revealing subgroups that are not lineage-dependent,
              but consist of different cancer types driven by a common genetic
              alteration. Application of the cancer genome atlas colorectal

               spanning several experimental conditions. We find substantial

               800 transcription factors. We show that in the morula,
               blastomeres coexpress transcription factors specific to
               different lineages, but by the 64-cell stage three cell types

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Single-cell technologies have recently gained
              popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their
              ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell populations.
              Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data has its own
              statistical and computational challenges. Popular multivariate
              approaches are based on data normalization, followed by dimension
              reduction and clustering to identify subgroups. However, in the
              case of cellular differentiation, we would not expect clear
              clusters to be present but instead expect the cells to follow
              continuous branching lineages. RESULTS: Here, we propose the use
              of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining
              differentiation trajectories. We adapt this method to single-cell
              data by adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of
              uncertainties or missing measurement values, which enables the
              establishment of a pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a
              high-dimensional gene expression space. We expect this output to
              reflect cell differentiation trajectories, where the data
              originates from intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from
              a pluripotent stage, cells move smoothly within the
              transcriptional landscape towards more differentiated states with
              some stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the
              robustness of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g.
              measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on
              simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative
              polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic
              stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an RNA-Seq data of
              human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps
              perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis and
              are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear dimension
              reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Calcium deficiency is a global public-health problem.
              Although the initial stage of calcium deficiency can lead to
              metabolic alterations or potential pathological changes, calcium
              deficiency is difficult to diagnose accurately. Moreover, the
              details of the molecular mechanism of calcium deficiency remain
              somewhat elusive. To accurately assess and provide appropriate
              nutritional intervention, we carried out a global analysis of
              metabolic alterations in response to calcium deficiency. METHODS:
              The metabolic alterations associated with calcium deficiency were
              first investigated in a rat model, using urinary metabonomics
              based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with
              quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and
              multivariate statistical analysis. Correlations between dietary
              calcium intake and the biomarkers identified from the rat model
              were further analyzed to confirm the potential application of
              these biomarkers in humans. RESULTS: Urinary metabolic-profiling
              analysis could preliminarily distinguish between
              calcium-deficient and non-deficient rats after a 2-week
              low-calcium diet. We established an integrated metabonomics
              strategy for identifying reliable biomarkers of calcium
              deficiency using a time-course analysis of discriminating
              metabolites in a low-calcium diet experiment, repeating the
              low-calcium diet experiment and performing a calcium-supplement
              experiment. In total, 27 biomarkers were identified, including
              glycine, oxoglutaric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, sebacic acid,
              pseudouridine, indoxyl sulfate, taurine, and phenylacetylglycine.
              The integrated urinary metabonomics analysis, which combined
              biomarkers with regular trends of change (types A, B, and C),
              could accurately assess calcium-deficient rats at different
              stages and clarify the dynamic pathophysiological changes and
              molecular mechanism of calcium deficiency in detail. Significant
              correlations between calcium intake and two biomarkers,
              pseudouridine (Pearson correlation, r = 0.53, P = 0.0001) and
              citrate (Pearson correlation, r = -0.43, P = 0.001), were further
              confirmed in 70 women. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the
              first report of reliable biomarkers of calcium deficiency, which
              were identified using an integrated strategy. The identified
              biomarkers give new insights into the pathophysiological changes
              and molecular mechanisms of calcium deficiency. The correlations
              between calcium intake and two of the biomarkers provide a
              rationale or potential for further assessment and elucidation of
              the metabolic responses of calcium deficiency in humans.",

  abstract  = "While there have been studies exploring regulatory variation in
               one or more tissues, the complexity of tissue-specificity in
               multiple primary tissues is not yet well understood. We explore
               in depth the role of cis-regulatory variation in three human
               tissues: lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), skin, and fat. The
               samples (156 LCL, 160 skin, 166 fat) were derived simultaneously
               from a subset of well-phenotyped healthy female twins of the
               MuTHER resource. We discover an abundance of cis-eQTLs in each
               tissue similar to previous estimates (858 or 4.7\% of genes). In
               addition, we apply factor analysis (FA) to remove effects of
               latent variables, thus more than doubling the number of our
               discoveries (1,822 eQTL genes). The unique study design (Matched
               Co-Twin Analysis---MCTA) permits immediate replication of eQTLs
               using co-twins (93\%--98\%) and validation of the considerable
               gain in eQTL discovery after FA correction. We highlight the
               challenges of comparing eQTLs between tissues. After verifying
               previous significance threshold-based estimates of
               tissue-specificity, we show their limitations given their
               dependency on statistical power. We propose that continuous
               estimates of the proportion of tissue-shared signals and direct
               comparison of the magnitude of effect on the fold change in
               expression are essential properties that jointly provide a
               biologically realistic view of tissue-specificity. Under this
               framework we demonstrate that 30\% of eQTLs are shared among the
               three tissues studied, while another 29\% appear exclusively
               tissue-specific. However, even among the shared eQTLs, a
               substantial proportion (10\%--20\%) have significant differences
               in the magnitude of fold change between genotypic classes across
               tissues. Our results underline the need to account for the
               complexity of eQTL tissue-specificity in an effort to assess
               consequences of such variants for complex traits.",

               be taken when collecting data to understand the relationship
               between two variables, such as a drug and its effect on a
               disease. In any given study there will be many other variables
               at play, such as the effects of age and sex on the disease. We
               show that in studies where the expression levels of thousands of
               genes are measured at once, these issues become surprisingly
               critical. Due to the complexity of our genomes, environment, and
               demographic features, there are many sources of variation when
               analyzing gene expression levels. In any given study, it is
               impossible to measure every single variable that may be
               influencing how our genes are expressed. Despite this, we show
               that by considering all expression levels simultaneously, one
               can actually recover the effects of these important missed
               variables and essentially produce an analysis as if all relevant
               variables were included. As opposed to traditional studies, the
               massive amount of data available in this setting is what makes
               the method, called surrogate variable analysis, possible. We

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Time course data are often used to study the changes
              to a biological process after perturbation. Statistical methods
              have been developed to determine whether such a perturbation
              induces changes over time, e.g. comparing a perturbed and
              unperturbed time course dataset to uncover differences. However,
              existing methods do not provide a principled statistical approach
              to identify the specific time when the two time course datasets
              first begin to diverge after a perturbation; we call this the
              perturbation time. Estimation of the perturbation time for
              different variables in a biological process allows us to identify
              the sequence of events following a perturbation and therefore
              provides valuable insights into likely causal relationships.
              RESULTS: We propose a Bayesian method to infer the perturbation
              time given time course data from a wild-type and perturbed
              system. We use a non-parametric approach based on Gaussian
              Process regression. We derive a probabilistic model of
              noise-corrupted and replicated time course data coming from the
              same profile before the perturbation time and diverging after the
              perturbation time. The likelihood function can be worked out
              exactly for this model and the posterior distribution of the
              perturbation time is obtained by a simple histogram approach,
              without recourse to complex approximate inference algorithms. We
              validate the method on simulated data and apply it to study the

  abstract = "Differentiation of na{\"\i}ve CD4+ T cells into functionally
              distinct T helper subsets is crucial for the orchestration of
              immune responses. Due to extensive heterogeneity and multiple
              overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell
              populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic
              dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and
              computational analysis using a temporal mixtures of Gaussian
              processes model, termed GPfates, we reconstructed the
              developmental trajectories of Th1 and Tfh cells during
              blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice. By tracking clonality
              using endogenous TCR sequences, we first demonstrated that
              Th1/Tfh bifurcation had occurred at both population and
              single-clone levels. Next, we identified genes whose expression
              was associated with Th1 or Tfh fates, and demonstrated a T-cell
              intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting a Th1
              differentiation. We also revealed the close molecular
              relationship between Th1 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in this
              infection. Th1 and Tfh fates emerged from a highly proliferative
              precursor that upregulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated
              cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene
              expression of chemokine receptors around bifurcation predicted
              roles for cell-cell in driving Th1/Tfh fates. In particular, we
              found that precursor Th cells were coached towards a Th1 but not
              a Tfh fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating
              genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided two
              unique resources, a database www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates
              discovery of novel factors controlling Th1/Tfh fate commitment,
              and more generally, GPfates, a modelling framework for
              characterizing cell differentiation towards multiple fates.",

               interacting to create a unique physiology. Within this network,
               the malignant cells encounter many challenges and rewire their
               metabolic properties accordingly. Such changes can be
               experienced and executed autonomously or through interaction
               with other cells in the tumor. The focus of this review is on
               the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment that leads to
               pathophysiologic interactions that are influenced and shaped by
               metabolism. They include symbiotic nutrient sharing, nutrient
               competition, and the role of metabolites as signaling molecules.
               Examples of such processes abound in normal organismal
               physiology, and such heterocellular metabolic interactions are
               repurposed to support tumor metabolism and growth. The
               importance and ubiquity of these processes are just beginning to
               be realized, and insights into their role in tumor development

              protein-protein interaction network to infer directed

               aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in ∼40\% of

              epigenome sequencing in an individual cell has not yet been

              preimplantation embryos. We found that within < 12 h of
              fertilization, each individual cell undergoes global genome
              demethylation together with the rapid and global reprogramming of
              both maternal and paternal genomes to a highly opened chromatin
              state. This was followed by decreased openness after the late
              zygote stage. Furthermore, from the late zygote to the 4-cell
              stage, the residual DNA methylation is preferentially preserved
              on intergenic regions of the paternal alleles and intragenic
              regions of maternal alleles in each individual blastomere.
              However, chromatin accessibility is similar between paternal and
              maternal alleles in each individual cell from the late zygote to
              the blastocyst stage. The binding motifs of several pluripotency
              regulators are enriched at distal nucleosome depleted regions
              from as early as the 2-cell stage. This indicates that the
              cis-regulatory elements of such target genes have been primed to
              an open state from the 2-cell stage onward, long before
              pluripotency is eventually established in the ICM of the
              blastocyst. Genes may be classified into homogeneously open,
              homogeneously closed and divergent states based on the chromatin
              accessibility of their promoter regions among individual cells.
              This can be traced to step-wise transitions during
              preimplantation development. Our study offers the first
              single-cell and parental allele-specific analysis of the
              genome-scale chromatin state and DNA methylation dynamics at
              single-base resolution in early mouse embryos and provides new
              insights into the heterogeneous yet highly ordered features of

                   sparsity-inducing prior over multiple latent factors and the
                   appropriate hyperpriors over all hyperparameters, resulting
                   in automatic rank determination. To learn the model, we
                   develop an efficient deterministic Bayesian inference
                   algorithm, which scales linearly with data size. Our method
                   is characterized as a tuning parameter-free approach, which
                   can effectively infer underlying multilinear factors with a
                   low-rank constraint, while also providing predictive
                   distributions over missing entries. Extensive simulations on
                   synthetic data illustrate the intrinsic capability of our
                   method to recover the ground-truth of CP rank and prevent
                   the overfitting problem, even when a large amount of entries
                   are missing. Moreover, the results from real-world
                   applications, including image inpainting and facial image
                   synthesis, demonstrate that our method outperforms
                   state-of-the-art approaches for both tensor factorization
                   and tensor completion in terms of predictive performance.",

  abstract = "We review the method of Parallel Factor Analysis, which
              simultaneously fits multiple two-way arrays or `slices' of a
              three-way array in terms of a common set of factors with
              differing relative weights in each `slice'. Mathematically, it is
              a straightforward generalization of the bilinear model of factor
              (or component) analysis (xij = $\Sigma$Rr = 1airbjr) to a
              trilinear model (xijk = $\Sigma$Rr = 1airbjrckr). Despite this
              simplicity, it has an important property not possessed by the
              two-way model: if the latent factors show adequately distinct
              patterns of three-way variation, the model is fully identified;
              the orientation of factors is uniquely determined by minimizing
              residual error, eliminating the need for a separate `rotation'
              phase of analysis. The model can be used several ways. It can be
              directly fit to a three-way array of observations with (possibly
              incomplete) factorial structure, or it can be indirectly fit to
              the original observations by fitting a set of covariance matrices
              computed from the observations, with each matrix corresponding to
              a two-way subset of the data. Even more generally, one can
              simultaneously analyze covariance matrices computed from
              different samples, perhaps corresponding to different treatment
              groups, different kinds of cases, data from different studies,
              etc. To demonstrate the method we analyze data from an experiment
              on right vs. left cerebral hemispheric control of the hands
              during various tasks. The factors found appear to correspond to
              the causal influences manipulated in the experiment, revealing
              their patterns of influence in all three ways of the data.
              Several generalizations of the parallel factor analysis model are
              currently under development, including ones that combine parallel
              factors with Tucker-like factor `interactions'. Of key importance
              is the need to increase the method's robustness against

                   first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference. It
                   also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to
                   build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an
                   optical character recognition system by first training a
                   character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a

              highlighted a particular challenge: to integrate the different
              views of the genome that are provided by various types of
              experimental data. RESULTS: This paper describes a computational
              framework for integrating and drawing inferences from a
              collection of genome-wide measurements. Each dataset is
              represented via a kernel function, which defines generalized
              similarity relationships between pairs of entities, such as genes
              or proteins. The kernel representation is both flexible and
              efficient, and can be applied to many different types of data.
              Furthermore, kernel functions derived from different types of
              data can be combined in a straightforward fashion. Recent
              advances in the theory of kernel methods have provided efficient
              algorithms to perform such combinations in a way that minimizes a
              statistical loss function. These methods exploit semidefinite
              programming techniques to reduce the problem of finding
              optimizing kernel combinations to a convex optimization problem.
              Computational experiments performed using yeast genome-wide
              datasets, including amino acid sequences, hydropathy profiles,
              gene expression data and known protein-protein interactions,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: To leverage the potential of multi-omics studies,
              exploratory data analysis methods that provide systematic
              integration and comparison of multiple layers of omics
              information are required. We describe multiple co-inertia
              analysis (MCIA), an exploratory data analysis method that
              identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional
              datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, MCIA
              simultaneously projects several datasets into the same
              dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the
              same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and
              facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis.
              RESULTS: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of
              information using MCIA, applied to two typical ``omics'' research
              scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles
              of cells in the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct,
              complementary features, which together increased the coverage and
              power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the
              importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in
              leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any
              individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles
              of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two
              different microarray platforms and next generation
              RNA-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and
              extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered
              that the variance of RNA-sequencing data processed using RPKM had
              greater variance than that with MapSplice and RSEM. We provided
              novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype
              combined from four data platforms. MCIA is implemented and
              available in the R/Bioconductor ``omicade4'' package. CONCLUSION:
              We believe MCIA is an attractive method for data integration and
              visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features
              observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not
              dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract
              important features even when there are not present across all
              datasets. MCIA provides simple graphical representations for the
              identification of relationships between large datasets.",

              species-environment relationships",
  author   = "Doledec, Sylvain and Chessel, Daniel",
  abstract = "SUMMARY 1 Methods used for the study of species?environment
              relationships can be grouped into: (i) simple indirect and direct
              gradient analysis and multivariate direct gradient analysis (e.g.
              canonical correspondence analysis), all of which search for
              non-symmetric patterns between environmental data sets and
              species data sets; and (ii) analysis of juxtaposed tables,
              canonical correlation analysis, and intertable ordination, which
              examine species?environment relationships by considering each
              data set equally. Different analytical techniques are appropriate
              for fulfilling different objectives. 2 We propose a method,
              co-inertia analysis, that can synthesize various approaches
              encountered in the ecological literature. Co-inertia analysis is
              based on the mathematically coherent Euclidean model and can be
              universally reproduced (i.e. independently of software) because
              of its numerical stability. The method performs simultaneous
              analysis of two tables. The optimizing criterion in co-inertia
              analysis is that the resulting sample scores (environmental
              scores and faunistic scores) are the most covariant. Such
              analysis is particularly suitable for the simultaneous detection
              of faunistic and environmental features in studies of ecosystem
              structure. 3 The method was demonstrated using faunistic and
              environmental data from Friday (Freshwater Biology 18, 87-104,
              1987). In this example, non-symmetric analyses is inappropriate
              because of the large number of variables (species and
              environmental variables) compared with the small number of
              samples. 4 Co-inertia analysis is an extension of the analysis of
              cross tables previously attempted by others. It serves as a
              general method to relate any kinds of data set, using any kinds
              of standard analysis (e.g. principal components analysis,
              correspondence analysis, multiple correspondence analysis) or
              between-class and within-class analyses.",

              correspondence between the expression of a gene and its protein
              is complicated. We apply a multivariate statistical method,

              of CpG islands is crucial to understand the epigenetic regulation
              of genes. The microarray-based Infinium methylation assay by
              Illumina is one platform for low-cost high-throughput methylation
              profiling. Both Beta-value and M-value statistics have been used
              as metrics to measure methylation levels. However, there are no
              detailed studies of their relations and their strengths and
              limitations. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the relationship
              between the Beta-value and M-value methods is a Logit
              transformation, and show that the Beta-value method has severe
              heteroscedasticity for highly methylated or unmethylated CpG
              sites. In order to evaluate the performance of the Beta-value and
              M-value methods for identifying differentially methylated CpG
              sites, we designed a methylation titration experiment. The
              evaluation results show that the M-value method provides much
              better performance in terms of Detection Rate (DR) and True
              Positive Rate (TPR) for both highly methylated and unmethylated
              CpG sites. Imposing a minimum threshold of difference can improve
              the performance of the M-value method but not the Beta-value
              method. We also provide guidance for how to select the threshold
              of methylation differences. CONCLUSIONS: The Beta-value has a
              more intuitive biological interpretation, but the M-value is more
              statistically valid for the differential analysis of methylation
              levels. Therefore, we recommend using the M-value method for
              conducting differential methylation analysis and including the

              that distinguish it from other cancers. Most CLL tumour cells are
              inert and arrested in G0/G1 of the cell cycle and there is only a
              small proliferative compartment; however, the progressive

              (MTZAP70(-) and poor unmutated ZAP70 positive (UMZAP70(+))
              prognosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the gene expression
              of B cells in 112 CLL patients divided into three classes: class
              1 with MTZAP70(-), class 2 with UMZAP70(+), and class 3 included
              both UMZAP70(-) and MTZAP70(+). RESULTS: We found LPL, AGPAT2,
              MBOAT1, CHPT1, AGPAT4, PLD1 genes encoding enzymes involved in
              lipid metabolism overexpressed in UMZAP70(+). In addition, this
              study identified ARSD, a gene belonging to the sphingolipid
              metabolism, as a new gene significantly overexpressed in
              UMZAP70(+) compared to MTZAP70(-). Western blots confirmed that
              ARSD protein levels were significantly different between the 3

              identified a significant correlation between ARSD and IGVH;
              however, both ARSD protein level and IGVH were independently
              associated with the need for therapy of CLL patients.
              CONCLUSIONS: ARSD is a novel prognostic factor as the time to
              start therapy is shorter in patients with high levels of ARSD
              protein and sphingolipid metabolism could represent a new

              package for examining differential expression of replicated count
              data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both
              biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are
              used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts,

              at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.
              The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,

               of temporally defined regulatory steps. However, this process
               has not been completely evaluated in single living mammalian
               cells. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the timing
               and coordination of gene activation events, we tracked the
               recruitment of GCN5 (histone acetyltransferase), RNA polymerase
               II, Brd2 and Brd4 (acetyl-lysine binding proteins), in relation
               to a VP16-transcriptional activator, to a transcription site
               that can be visualized in single living cells. All accumulated
               rapidly with the VP16 activator as did the transcribed RNA. RNA
               was also detected at significantly more transcription sites in
               cells expressing the VP16-activator compared to a p53-activator.
               After $\alpha$-amanitin pre-treatment, the VP16-activator, GCN5,
               and Brd2 are still recruited to the transcription site but the
               chromatin does not decondense. Conclusions/Significance This
               study demonstrates that a strong activator can rapidly overcome
               the condensed chromatin structure of an inactive transcription
               site and supercede the expected requirement for regulatory
               events to proceed in a temporally defined order. Additionally,
               activator strength determines the number of cells in which
               transcription is induced as well as the extent of chromatin
               decondensation. As chromatin decondensation is significantly
               reduced after $\alpha$-amanitin pre-treatment, despite the
               recruitment of transcriptional activation factors, this provides
               further evidence that transcription drives large-scale chromatin
               decondensation.",

  abstract  = "Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate
               data sets with multiple missing expression values.
               Unfortunately, many algorithms for gene expression analysis
               require a complete matrix of gene array values as input. For
               example, methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means
               clustering are not robust to missing data, and may lose
               effectiveness even with a few missing values. Methods for
               imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to minimize the
               effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to increase the
               range of data sets to which these algorithms can be applied. In
               this report, we investigate automated methods for estimating
               missing data.Results: We present a comparative study of several
               methods for the estimation of missing values in gene microarray
               data. We implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular
               Value Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted
               K-nearest neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated
               the methods using a variety of parameter settings and over
               different real data sets, and assessed the robustness of the
               imputation methods to the amount of missing data over the range
               of 1--20\% missing values. We show that KNNimpute appears to
               provide a more robust and sensitive method for missing value
               estimation than SVDimpute, and both SVDimpute and KNNimpute
               surpass the commonly used row average method (as well as filling
               missing values with zeros). We report results of the comparative
               experiments and provide recommendations and tools for accurate
               estimation of missing microarray data under a variety of

              model of Cox (1972, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society,
              Series B, 34, 187?220), it is often desired to test a subset of
              the vector of unknown regression parameters ? in the expression
              for the hazard rate at time t. The likelihood ratio test
              statistic is well behaved in most situations but may be expensive
              to calculate. The Wald (1943, Transactions of the American
              Mathematical Society 54, 426?482) test statistic is easier to
              calculate, but has some drawbacks. In testing a single parameter
              in a binomial logit model, Hauck and Donner (1977, Journal of the
              American Statistical Association 72, 851?853) show that the Wald
              statistic decreases to zero the further the parameter estimate is
              from the null and that the asymptotic power of the test decreases
              to the significance level. The Wald statistic is extensively used
              in statistical software packages for survivorship modelling and
              it is therefore important to understand its behavior. The present
              work examines empirically the behavior of the Wald statistic
              under various departures from the null hypothesis and under the
              presence of Type I censoring and covariates in the model. It is
              shown via examples that the Wald statistic's behavior is not as
              aberrant as found for the logistic model. For the single
              parameter case, the asymptotic non-null distribution of the Wald

Images reconstructed from tissue sections scanned by IMC have a resolution comparable to light microscopy, with the high content of mass cytometry enabled through the use of isotopically labeled probes and ICP-MS detection. Importantly, IMC can be performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections, so can be applied to the retrospective analysis of patient cohorts whose outcome is known, and eventually to personalized medicine. Since the original description in 2014, IMC has evolved rapidly into a commercial instrument of unprecedented power for the analysis of histological sections. In this Review, we discuss the underlying principles of this new technology, and outline emerging applications of IMC in the analysis of normal and pathological tissues. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry}

    abstract = { Macrophages are myeloid immune cells that are strategically positioned throughout the body tissues, where they ingest and degrade dead cells, debris, and foreign material and orchestrate inflammatory processes. Here we review two major recent paradigm shifts in our understanding of tissue macrophage biology. The first is the realization that most tissue-resident macrophages are established prenatally and maintained through adulthood by longevity and self-renewal. Their generation and maintenance are thus independent from ongoing hematopoiesis, although the cells can be complemented by adult monocyte-derived macrophages. Second, aside from being immune sentinels, tissue macrophages form integral components of their host tissue. This entails their specialization in response to local environmental cues to contribute to the development and specific function of their tissue of residence. Factors that govern tissue macrophage specialization are emerging. Moreover, tissue specialization is reflected in discrete gene expression profiles of macrophages, as well as epigenetic signatures reporting actual and potential enhancer usage. }

              gene expression. However, this goal can only be achieved if all
              information sources are used in concert. RESULTS: Our method
              integrates literature information, DNA sequences and expression
              arrays. A set of relevant transcription factors is defined on the
              basis of literature. Sequence data are used to identify potential
              target genes and the results are used to define a prior
              distribution on the topology of the regulatory network. A
              Bayesian hidden component model for the expression array data
              allows us to identify which of the potential binding sites are
              actually used by the regulatory proteins in the studied cell

@ARTICLE{Mitchell1988-zh,
  title     = "Bayesian Variable Selection in Linear Regression",
  author    = "Mitchell, T J and Beauchamp, J J",
  abstract  = "Abstract This article is concerned with the selection of subsets
               of predictor variables in a linear regression model for the
               prediction of a dependent variable. It is based on a Bayesian
               approach, intended to be as objective as possible. A probability
               distribution is first assigned to the dependent variable through
               the specification of a family of prior distributions for the
               unknown parameters in the regression model. The method is not
               fully Bayesian, however, because the ultimate choice of prior
               distribution from this family is affected by the data. It is
               assumed that the predictors represent distinct observables; the
               corresponding regression coefficients are assigned independent
               prior distributions. For each regression coefficient subject to
               deletion from the model, the prior distribution is a mixture of
               a point mass at 0 and a diffuse uniform distribution elsewhere,
               that is, a ?spike and slab? distribution. The random error
               component is assigned a normal distribution with mean 0 and
               standard deviation $\sigma$, where ln($\sigma$) has a locally
               uniform noninformative prior distribution. The appropriate
               posterior probabilities are derived for each submodel. If the
               regression coefficients have identical priors, the posterior
               distribution depends only on the data and the parameter ?, which
               is the height of the spike divided by the height of the slab for
               the common prior distribution. This parameter is not assigned a
               probability distribution; instead, it is considered a parameter
               that indexes the members of a class of Bayesian methods.
               Graphical methods are proposed as informal guides for choosing
               ?, assessing the complexity of the response function and the
               strength of the individual predictor variables, and assessing
               the degree of uncertainty about the best submodel. The following
               plots against ? are suggested: (a) posterior probability that a
               particular regression coefficient is 0; (b) posterior expected
               number of terms in the model; (c) posterior entropy of the
               submodel distribution; (d) posterior predictive error; and (e)
               posterior probability of goodness of fit. Plots (d) and (e) are
               suggested as ways to choose y. The predictive error is
               determined using a Bayesian cross-validation approach that
               generates a predictive density for each observation, given all
               of the data except that observation, that is, a type of ?leave
               one out? approach. The goodness-of-fit measure is the sum of the
               posterior probabilities of all submodels that pass a standard F
               test for goodness of fit relative to the full model, at a
               specified level of significance. The dependence of the results
               on the scaling of the variables is discussed, and some ways to
               choose the scaling constants are suggested. Examples based on a
               large data set arising from an energy-conservation study are
               given to demonstrate the application of the methods.",

  abstract  = "Author Summary Daily interactions between individuals can
               influence their health both in positive and negative ways. Often
               the mechanisms mediating social effects are unknown, so current
               approaches to study social effects are limited to a few
               phenotypes for which the mediating mechanisms are known a priori
               or suspected. Here we propose to leverage the fact that most
               traits are genetically controlled to investigate the influence
               of the social environment. To do so, we study associations
               between genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another
               individual (social genetic effects, SGE, also called indirect
               genetic effects). Importantly, SGE can be studied even when the
               traits that mediate the influence of the social environment are
               not known. For the first time we quantified the contribution of
               SGE to more than 100 organismal phenotypes and genome-wide gene
               expression measured in laboratory mice. We find that genetic
               variation in cage mates (i.e. SGE) explains up to 29\% of the
               variation in anxiety, wound healing, immune function, and body
               weight. Hence our study uncovers an unexpectedly large influence
               of the social environment. Additionally, we show that ignoring
               SGE can severely bias estimates of direct genetic effects
               (effects of an individual's genotypes on its own phenotype),
               which has important implications for the study of the genetic
               basis of complex traits.",

              Immunohistochemistry and western blotting indicated that the
              expression levels of octamer‑binding transcription factor 4 in
              the DKK1‑treated ESC group were significantly greater compared

              Anterior neuroectoderm markers are widely expressed, at least in

              millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a
              reference genome. In many applications, the key information
              required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping
              to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene.
              The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read
              summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses
              but has so far received relatively little attention in the
              literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read
              summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from
              either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts
              implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature
              blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing
              methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization)

              downstream of wnt8 in patterning of the mesoderm and
              neuroectoderm because (1) overexpression of sp5-like, like
              overexpression of wnt8, posteriorizes the neuroectoderm, (2)
              sp5-like morpholino-mediated knockdown, like wnt8 knockdown,
              causes anteriorization of the hindbrain, (3) combined knockdown
              of sp5 and sp5-like, like loss of wnt8, causes expansion of
              dorsal mesoderm, (4) sp5-like knockdown reduces the defects in
              mesoderm and neuroectoderm patterning caused by wnt8
              overexpression, and (5) inhibition of sp5-like enhances the
              effects of hypomorphic loss of wnt8. Importantly, (6)
              overexpression of sp5-like is able to partially restore normal
              hindbrain patterning in wnt8 morphants. CONCLUSIONS: sp5-like is
              a direct target of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during gastrulation
              and, together with sp5, acts as a required mediator of the
              activities of wnt8 in patterning the mesoderm and neuroectoderm.
              We conclude that sp5 transcription factors mediate the downstream
              responses to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in several developmental
              processes in zebrafish.",

              of 5-methylcytosine by the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family
              of dioxygenases can lead to demethylation. Although cytosine
              methylation has key roles in several processes such as genomic
              imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation, the functional
              significance of cytosine methylation and demethylation in mouse
              embryogenesis remains to be fully determined. Here we show that
              inactivation of all three Tet genes in mice leads to gastrulation
              phenotypes, including primitive streak patterning defects in
              association with impaired maturation of axial mesoderm and failed
              specification of paraxial mesoderm, mimicking phenotypes in

              expression of the Lefty1 and Lefty2 genes, which encode
              inhibitors of Nodal signalling. Moreover, reduction in Lefty gene
              expression is linked to elevated DNA methylation, as both
              Lefty-Nodal signalling and normal morphogenesis are largely
              restored in Tet-deficient embryos when the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b

              specifically abolishes the dioxygenase activity causes similar
              morphological and molecular abnormalities as the null mutation.
              Taken together, our results show that TET-mediated oxidation of
              5-methylcytosine modulates Lefty-Nodal signalling by promoting
              demethylation in opposition to methylation by DNMT3A and DNMT3B.
              These findings reveal a fundamental epigenetic mechanism

              independent of presenilin 1 (Psen1), which is a Notch signal
              mediator. To further refine our hypothesis, we have analyzed
              genetic interactions between Dll1, Dll3, Mesp2 and Psen1, and
              elucidated the roles of Dll1- and Dll3-Notch pathways, with or

              Additionally, our epistatic analysis revealed that Mesp2 affects
              rostrocaudal properties more directly than Dll1 or Dll3. Finally,
              we find that Psen1 is involved differently in the regulation of
              rostral and caudal genes. Psen1 is required for Dll1-Notch
              signaling for activation of Dll1, while the Psen1-independent
              Dll3-Notch pathway may counteract the Psen1-dependent Dll1-Notch
              pathway. These observations suggest that Dll1 and Dll3 may have
              non-redundant, even counteracting functions. We conclude from our
              analyses that Mesp2 functions as a central mediator of such Notch
              pathways and regulates the gene expression required for
              rostrocaudal patterning of somites.",

        abstract = {Understanding the emergence of complex multicellular organisms from single totipotent cells, or ontogenesis, represents a foundational question in biology. The study of mammalian development is particularly challenging due to the difficulty of monitoring embryos in utero, the variability of progenitor field sizes, and the indeterminate relationship between the generation of uncommitted progenitors and their progression to subsequent stages. Here, we present a flexible, high information, multi-channel molecular recorder with a single cell (sc) readout and apply it as an evolving lineage tracer to define a mouse cell fate map from fertilization through gastrulation. By combining lineage information with scRNA-seq profiles, we recapitulate canonical developmental relationships between different tissue types and reveal an unexpected transcriptional convergence of endodermal cells from extra-embryonic and embryonic origins, illustrating how lineage information complements scRNA-seq to define cell types. Finally, we apply our cell fate map to estimate the number of embryonic progenitor cells and the degree of asymmetric partitioning within the pluripotent epiblast during specification. Our approach enables massively parallel, high-resolution recording of lineage and other information in mammalian systems to facilitate a quantitative framework for describing developmental processes.},

              characterized by lineage bias and reduced stem cell function, the
              molecular basis of which is largely unknown. Using single-cell
              transcriptomics, we identified a distinct subpopulation of old
              HSCs carrying a p53 signature indicative of stem cell decline
              alongside pro-proliferative JAK/STAT signaling. To investigate
              the relationship between JAK/STAT and p53 signaling, we
              challenged HSCs with a constitutively active form of JAK2 (V617F)
              and observed an expansion of the p53-positive subpopulation in
              old mice. Our results reveal cellular heterogeneity in the onset
              of HSC aging and implicate a role for JAK2V617F-driven
              proliferation in the p53-mediated functional decline of old HSCs.",

              from the model organism Mus musculus comprising nearly 100,000

              populations of cells in many tissues. Furthermore, they allow for
              direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types
              shared between tissues, such as immune cells from distinct
              anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used
              for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3-end
              counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively
              low coverage, while the other, FACS-based full length transcript
