abstract = "The process of gastrulation is a pivotal step in the formation of the vertebrate body plan. The primary function of gastrulation is the correct placement of precursor tissues for subsequent morphogenesis. There is now mounting evidence that the body plan is established through inductive interactions between germ layer tissues and by the global patterning activity emanating from embryonic organizers. An increasing number of mouse mutants have been described that have gastrulation defects, providing important insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate this complex process. In this review, we explore the mouse embryo before and during gastrulation, highlighting its similarities with other vertebrate embryos and its unique characteristics."

    abstract = "{Over the past few years, advances in molecular technologies have allowed unprecedented mapping of epigenetic modifications in gametes and during early embryonic development. This work is allowing a detailed genomic analysis, which for the first time can answer long-standing questions about epigenetic regulation and reprogramming, and highlights differences between mouse and human, the implications of which are only beginning to be explored.In this review, we summarise new low-cell molecular methods enabling the interrogation of epigenetic information in gametes and early embryos, the mechanistic insights these have provided, and contrast the findings in mouse and human.Relevant studies were identified by PubMed search.We discuss the levels of epigenetic regulation, from DNA modifications to chromatin organisation, during mouse gametogenesis, fertilisation and pre- and post-implantation development. The recently characterised features of the oocyte epigenome highlight its exceptionally unique regulatory landscape. The chromatin organisation and epigenetic landscape of both gametic genomes are rapidly reprogrammed after fertilisation. This extensive epigenetic remodelling is necessary for zygotic genome activation, but the mechanistic link remains unclear. While the vast majority of epigenetic information from the gametes is erased in pre-implantation development, new insights suggest that repressive histone modifications from the oocyte may mediate a novel mechanism of imprinting. To date, the characterisation of epigenetics in human development has been almost exclusively limited to DNA methylation profiling; these data reinforce that the global dynamics are conserved between mouse and human. However, as we look closer, it is becoming apparent that the mechanisms regulating these dynamics are distinct. These early findings emphasise the importance of investigations of fundamental epigenetic mechanisms in both mouse and humans.Failures in epigenetic regulation have been implicated in human disease and infertility. With increasing maternal age and use of reproductive technologies in countries all over the world, it is becoming ever more important to understand the necessary processes required to establish a developmentally competent embryo. Furthermore, it is essential to evaluate the extent to which these epigenetic patterns are sensitive to such technologies and other adverse environmental exposures.}",

abstract = {Abstract Ultrastructural studies and lineage analyses of gastrulating mouse embryos have revealed that differnt morphogenetic tissue movements are involved in the formation of the three definitive germ layers. Definitive ectoderm is formed by epibolic expansion of the pre-existing progenitor population in the embryonic ectoderm. Formation of the mesoderm and the endoderm is initiated by cellular ingression at the primitive streak. The mesodermal layer is established by cell migration and cell sheet spreading, but the endoderm is formed by replacing the original primitive endodermal population. To this date, genes that are expressed during mouse gastrulation mostly encode cell surface adhesion or signalling molecules, growth factors and their receptors, and putative transcriptional factors. Their precise role during gastrulation remains to be investigated. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},,

This process is captured in a lineage tree: a diagram of every cell{\textquoteright}s ancestry back to the founding zygote. Biologists have long sought to trace this cell lineage tree in individual organisms and have developed a variety of technologies to map the progeny of specific cells. However, there are billions to trillions of cells in complex organisms, and conventional approaches can only map a limited number of clonal populations per experiment. A new generation of tools that use molecular recording methods integrated with single cell profiling technologies may provide a solution. Here, we summarize recent breakthroughs in these technologies, outline experimental and computational challenges, and discuss biological questions that can be addressed using single cell dynamic lineage tracing.},

The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open data, code, and community.},

Here we demonstrate that two recently identified DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, are essential for de novo methylation and for mouse development. Inactivation of both genes by gene targeting blocks de novo methylation in ES cells and early embryos, but it has no effect on maintenance of imprinted methylation patterns. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b also exhibit nonoverlapping functions in development, with Dnmt3b specifically required for methylation of centromeric minor satellite repeats. Mutations of human DNMT3B are found in ICF syndrome, a developmental defect characterized by hypomethylation of pericentromeric repeats. Our results indicate that both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b function as de novo methyltransferases that play important roles in normal development and disease."
