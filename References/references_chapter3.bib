abstract = "The process of gastrulation is a pivotal step in the formation of the vertebrate body plan. The primary function of gastrulation is the correct placement of precursor tissues for subsequent morphogenesis. There is now mounting evidence that the body plan is established through inductive interactions between germ layer tissues and by the global patterning activity emanating from embryonic organizers. An increasing number of mouse mutants have been described that have gastrulation defects, providing important insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate this complex process. In this review, we explore the mouse embryo before and during gastrulation, highlighting its similarities with other vertebrate embryos and its unique characteristics."

    abstract = "{Over the past few years, advances in molecular technologies have allowed unprecedented mapping of epigenetic modifications in gametes and during early embryonic development. This work is allowing a detailed genomic analysis, which for the first time can answer long-standing questions about epigenetic regulation and reprogramming, and highlights differences between mouse and human, the implications of which are only beginning to be explored.In this review, we summarise new low-cell molecular methods enabling the interrogation of epigenetic information in gametes and early embryos, the mechanistic insights these have provided, and contrast the findings in mouse and human.Relevant studies were identified by PubMed search.We discuss the levels of epigenetic regulation, from DNA modifications to chromatin organisation, during mouse gametogenesis, fertilisation and pre- and post-implantation development. The recently characterised features of the oocyte epigenome highlight its exceptionally unique regulatory landscape. The chromatin organisation and epigenetic landscape of both gametic genomes are rapidly reprogrammed after fertilisation. This extensive epigenetic remodelling is necessary for zygotic genome activation, but the mechanistic link remains unclear. While the vast majority of epigenetic information from the gametes is erased in pre-implantation development, new insights suggest that repressive histone modifications from the oocyte may mediate a novel mechanism of imprinting. To date, the characterisation of epigenetics in human development has been almost exclusively limited to DNA methylation profiling; these data reinforce that the global dynamics are conserved between mouse and human. However, as we look closer, it is becoming apparent that the mechanisms regulating these dynamics are distinct. These early findings emphasise the importance of investigations of fundamental epigenetic mechanisms in both mouse and humans.Failures in epigenetic regulation have been implicated in human disease and infertility. With increasing maternal age and use of reproductive technologies in countries all over the world, it is becoming ever more important to understand the necessary processes required to establish a developmentally competent embryo. Furthermore, it is essential to evaluate the extent to which these epigenetic patterns are sensitive to such technologies and other adverse environmental exposures.}",

abstract = {Abstract Ultrastructural studies and lineage analyses of gastrulating mouse embryos have revealed that differnt morphogenetic tissue movements are involved in the formation of the three definitive germ layers. Definitive ectoderm is formed by epibolic expansion of the pre-existing progenitor population in the embryonic ectoderm. Formation of the mesoderm and the endoderm is initiated by cellular ingression at the primitive streak. The mesodermal layer is established by cell migration and cell sheet spreading, but the endoderm is formed by replacing the original primitive endodermal population. To this date, genes that are expressed during mouse gastrulation mostly encode cell surface adhesion or signalling molecules, growth factors and their receptors, and putative transcriptional factors. Their precise role during gastrulation remains to be investigated. Â© 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},,

The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open data, code, and community.},

abstract ={Cross-talk between DNA methylation and histone modifications drives the establishment of composite epigenetic signatures and is traditionally studied using correlative rather than direct approaches. Here, we present sequential ChIP-bisulfite-sequencing (ChIP-BS-seq) as an approach to quantitatively assess DNA methylation patterns associated with chromatin modifications or chromatin-associated factors directly. A chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-capturing step is used to obtain a restricted representation of the genome occupied by the epigenetic feature of interest, for which a single-base resolution DNA methylation map is then generated. When applied to H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), we found that H3K27me3 and DNA methylation are compatible throughout most of the genome, except for CpG islands, where these two marks are mutually exclusive. Further ChIP-BS-seq-based analysis in Dnmt triple-knockout (TKO) embryonic stem cells revealed that total loss of CpG methylation is associated with alteration of H3K27me3 levels throughout the genome: H3K27me3 in localized peaks is decreased while broad local enrichments (BLOCs) of H3K27me3 are formed. At an even broader scale, these BLOCs correspond to regions of high DNA methylation in wild-type ES cells, suggesting that DNA methylation prevents H3K27me3 deposition locally and at a megabase scale. Our strategy provides a unique way of investigating global interdependencies between DNA methylation and other chromatin features.},

Here we demonstrate that two recently identified DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, are essential for de novo methylation and for mouse development. Inactivation of both genes by gene targeting blocks de novo methylation in ES cells and early embryos, but it has no effect on maintenance of imprinted methylation patterns. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b also exhibit nonoverlapping functions in development, with Dnmt3b specifically required for methylation of centromeric minor satellite repeats. Mutations of human DNMT3B are found in ICF syndrome, a developmental defect characterized by hypomethylation of pericentromeric repeats. Our results indicate that both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b function as de novo methyltransferases that play important roles in normal development and disease."

  abstract = {Extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs during preimplantation embryo development and is accompanied by zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and first cell fate specification. Recent studies using single-cell epigenome sequencing techniques have provided global views of the dynamics of different epigenetic layers during this period. However, it remains largely unclear how the drastic epigenetic reprogramming contributes to transcriptional regulatory network. Here, we developed a single-cell multiomics sequencing technology (scNOMeRe-seq) that enables profiling of genome-wide chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression in the same individual cell with improved performance compared to that of earlier techniques. We applied this method to analyze the global dynamics of different molecular layers and their associations in mouse preimplantation embryos. We found that global DNA methylation remodeling facilitates the reconstruction of genetic lineages in early embryos and revealed that the gradual increases in heterogeneity among blastomeres are driven by asymmetric cleavage. Allele-specific DNA methylation pattern is maintained throughout preimplantation development and is accompanied by allele-specific associations between DNA methylation and gene expression in the gene body that are inherited from oocytes and sperm. Through integrated analyses of the collective dynamics between gene expression and chromatin accessibility, we constructed a ZGA-associated regulatory network and revealed coordination among multiple epigenetic layers, transcription factors (TFs) and repeat elements that instruct the proper ZGA process. Moreover, we found that inner cell mass (ICM)/trophectoderm (TE) lineage-associated cis-regulatory elements are stepwise activated in blastomeres during post-ZGA embryo stages. TE lineage-specific TFs play dual roles in promoting the TE program while repressing the ICM program, thereby separating the TE lineage from the ICM lineage. Taken together, our findings not only depict the first single-cell triple-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during mouse preimplantation development but also enhance the fundamental understanding of epigenetic regulation in early embryos.},
