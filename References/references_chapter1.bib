   Abstract = {Mammalian organogenesis is a remarkable process. Within a short timeframe, the cells of the three germ layers transform into an embryo that includes most of the major internal and external organs. Here we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of mouse organogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing, we profiled the transcriptomes of around 2 million cells derived from 61 embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation, in a single experiment. The resulting mouse organogenesis cell atlas (MOCA) provides a global view of developmental processes during this critical window. We use Monocle 3 to identify hundreds of cell types and 56 trajectories, many of which are detected only because of the depth of cellular coverage, and collectively define thousands of corresponding marker genes. We explore the dynamics of gene expression within cell types and trajectories over time, including focused analyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle.},

The advent of genotyping arrays enabled large-scale genome-wide association studies and methods for examining global transcript levels, which gave rise to the field of integrative genetics. Other omics technologies, such as proteomics and metabolomics, are now often incorporated into the everyday methodology of biological researchers. In this review, we provide an overview of such omics technologies and focus on methods for their integration across multiple omics layers. As compared to studies of a single omics type, multi-omics offers the opportunity to understand the flow of information that underlies disease.},

   ABSTRACT={Multi-omics data integration is one of the major challenges in the era of precision medicine. Considerable work has been done with the advent of high-throughput studies, which have enabled the data access for downstream analyses. To improve the clinical outcome prediction, a gamut of software tools has been developed. This review outlines the progress done in the field of multi-omics integration and comprehensive tools developed so far in this field. Further, we discuss the integration methods to predict patient survival at the end of the review.}
